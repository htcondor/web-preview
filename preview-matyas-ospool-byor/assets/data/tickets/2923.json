Secondarily it could be used to find out its version (and perhaps its entire daemon ad).\n\n</p><p>Ideally, this could be used for any daemon.  Also, it could be useful against remote hosts.\n\n</p><p>I'm assigning it to Greg for lack of a better person.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nDuplicate of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3371\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3371'); return false;\" title=\"Create authorization ping tool\">#3371</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Apr-25 09:55", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2012-Apr-05 16:00", "fixed_version": "2012-Apr-05 16:00", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "kronenfe@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
