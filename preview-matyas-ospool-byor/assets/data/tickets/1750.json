However, there are other types of failures (such as network disconnect) where file transfer can fail without trying to put the job on hold. These cases used to be handled by the shadow/starter disconnect behavior. Now, the starter just blows up in an assert:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>11/01 14:58:57 Sandbox transfer failed.\n11/01 14:58:57 ERROR \"Assertion ERROR on (m_ft_info.hold_code != 0)\" at line 435 in file jic_shadow.cpp\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I see the following responsible code:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>if(!m_ft_info.success) {\n   ASSERT(m_ft_info.hold_code != 0);\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>One way to test this code path is to SIGSTOP the shadow while the job is running. Then when the job finishes and the starter is blocked waiting for a response to its file transfer request, do condor_off -schedd. The desired behavior is that the starter sees the connection to the shadow go bad and enters disconnected mode. Turning the schedd back on should cause a new shadow to connect to the starter and successfully finish the file transfer. I have verified that this worked in 7.4.2.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Nov-02 11:34:45 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI reviewed it.
