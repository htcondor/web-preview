{"id": 682, "title": "Ticket #682: Reduce port usage of gass server hack", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe have a hack to the globus gass server library used in the gt2 gahp to improve parallelism. The globus libraries will only authenticate one connection at a time for a given globus_io handle. For the hack, we create 20 globus_io handles for listening, then copy the file descriptor from the first handle to the other 19 (and close the other fds). We end up with 20 globus_io handles for 1 listening port. This allows us to authenticate 20 incoming connections in parallel.\n\n<p>The drawback to this is we need 20 ports at startup, though only one is retained. Igor Sfiligoi is dealing with sites that want to place severe limits on the number of open ports in their firewalls.\n\n</p><p>The hack can be modified to close each additional fd as the additional globus_io handles are created. Then, only 1 additional port is necessary, rather than 19.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:07", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Aug-20 11:28", "fixed_version": "2009-Aug-20 11:28", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "sfiligoi@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
