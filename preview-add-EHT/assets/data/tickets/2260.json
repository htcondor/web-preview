{"id": 2260, "title": "Ticket #2260: Optional compression during file transfer", "description": "<blockquote>\nSometimes a user has some large input or output files that are easily compressed.  Plain text is common.  Compressing them over the wire would speed up transfers and reduce bandwidth usage; good for everyone.  The cost in process time is minimal if zlib is set to use the lowest compression level (1 AKA Z_BEST_SPEED).\n\n<p>The current workaround is to compress the files manually, then teach your program to uncompress them or add a wrapper script to do the uncompression.  Either option adds unnecessary complexity.\n\n</p><p>Proposal 1: Always enable compression during file transfer.  If investigation shows that the CPU overhead is trivial, this will help users with compressible data at negligible cost to everyone else.\n\n</p><p>Proposal 2: if the CPU cost isn't negligible, allow users to toggle the option on a per job or perhaps per file basis.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Jun-21 14:20", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Jun-21 14:20", "fixed_version": "2011-Jun-21 14:20", "broken_version": "v070700", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
