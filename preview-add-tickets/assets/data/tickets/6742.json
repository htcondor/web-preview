{"id": 6742, "title": "Ticket #6742: Undefined job policy expressions should result in default action", "description": "<blockquote>\nToday, if a job policy expression evaluates to Undefined, the job is held with a  reason code indicating the policy expressions are faulty. Users can easily end up in this situation when referencing attributes that aren't always present in the job ad (e.g. attributes that only appear when the job is in certain states or once the job starts running for the first time). This seems overly hostile to the user. This should be changed so that the default behavior is performed when the value is Undefined (i.e. don't hold job, don't release job, let completed job leave queue).</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2021-Apr-28 16:32:38 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is now jira ticket HTCONDOR-442.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2021-Apr-28 16:32", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2018-Aug-16 15:33", "fixed_version": "2018-Aug-16 15:33", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
