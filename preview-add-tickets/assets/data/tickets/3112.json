{"id": 3112, "title": "Ticket #3112: Path to main class/jar file of java job broken in condor_submit", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen a relative path is used for the <code>executable</code> attribute for a java universe job, the path is treated is relative to the CWD and the job's initialdir in different parts of condor_submit. This causes condor_submit to fail if these are different directories.\n\n<p>Condor_submit first checks that the executable is readable, resolving relative paths based on the CWD. Then, for java universe jobs, the executable is added to the list of input files to be transferred. This list is passed to <code>process_input_file_list()</code>, which checks that they are readable, and resolves all relative paths based on the job's initialdir.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Jul-06 11:52", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jul-06 11:52", "fixed_version": "2012-Jul-06 11:52", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "a23697", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
