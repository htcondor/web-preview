The Schedd will never <strong>run</strong> a job as root, but if one exists in the schedd, it will repeatedly get matched and attempt to run.\n\n<p>This wastes the Schedd's time.\n\n</p><p>The Schedd should have a submit-time check that prevents any attempt to set the Owner attribute of a job to root to prevent this waste of effort and reject submissions that attempt to submit as root regardless of what submission method is used.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:43:03 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080808 to v080809 using ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-22 11:53:28 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong class=\"two\">CODE REVIEW</strong>\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>Should do a case-insensitive string comparison, at least for the Windows username check.\n</li><li>Otherwise looks good to me.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-May-04 09:28:29 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nNo a case senstive check is not required for LOCAL_SYSTEM or SYSTEM.
