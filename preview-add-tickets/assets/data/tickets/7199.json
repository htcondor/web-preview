{"id": 7199, "title": "Ticket #7199: Monitor GPU memory usage per job", "description": "<blockquote>\nLIGO is moving forward with multiple jobs using the same GPU, so they need per-job GPU usage information.  Because over-committing memory is dangerous on GPUs (whereas over-committing compute is just slow), the emphasis is on memory usage, although I expect that core utilization will come along for free in any reasonable solution to this problem.\n\n<p>This will probably require a design document: neither TJ nor I particularly like the idea of trying to tie PIDs to jobs via the existing <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SlotMergeConstraint\" title=\"Slot Merge Constraint\">SlotMergeConstraint</a></span> mechanism, and we expect there will be other benefits to moving the GPU-handling code inside the HTCondor codebase.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nBumping up to priority 3.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Oct-20 10:49:02 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nGreg thinks Todd M. may have made progress on something related to this?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2021-May-04 10:51:57 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nThis would still be useful, but may not be the most important \"next step\" to making our use of GPUs more efficient.
