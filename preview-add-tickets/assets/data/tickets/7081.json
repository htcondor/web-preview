{"id": 7081, "title": "Ticket #7081: Leverage SANs for GSI host authentication", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt appears that GSI host verification is not working with SANs (particularly in the context of the HTCondor-CE).  This means that a unique certificate is required for each CE -- a somewhat costly proposition if you are paying per-certificate.\n\n<p>I believe the underlying GSI libraries support SANs, so the fix is potentially straightforward.\n\n</p><p>In order to test, one can easily get a cert with appropriate SANs utilizing Let's Encrypt.  May need to control the DNS settings of a web domain to do this.\n\n</p><p>Reported by Bockjoo Kim from UFlorida.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-May-30 09:09", "status": "new", "created": "2019-May-30 09:09", "fixed_version": "2019-May-30 09:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "bbockelm", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelman@morgridge.org", "due_date": ""}
