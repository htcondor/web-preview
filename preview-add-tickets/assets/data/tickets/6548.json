{"id": 6548, "title": "Ticket #6548: input files fetched using a filetransfer plugin are stored in SPOOL", "description": "<blockquote>\nReported by Lauren.  Input files that are fetched using a filetransfer plugin are being stored in spool when a job is evicted, leading to filling up the SPOOL directory for jobs that are self-checkpointing.\n\n<p>I suppose the file should be re-fetched via plugin when restarting the job.  That is a big enough change that this should go in devel, not stable.  More investigation needed to fully understand the issue, but should be trivial to reproduce.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2018-Feb-01 11:04", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Feb-01 11:04", "fixed_version": "2018-Feb-01 11:04", "broken_version": "v080700", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "FileTransfer", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
