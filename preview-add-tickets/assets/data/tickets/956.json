{"id": 956, "title": "Ticket #956: We should have a backtrace log", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe should have a subsystem dependent log file devoted strictly to backtraces. The dprintf system could keep a cyclic buffer of N lines in the current debugging modes so that when the back trace happens, those N lines plus the backtrace get emitted to the file with demarcation lines around it. Then one can simply look at the backtraces as they happen with a little bit of context without having to dig around in much faster rotating logs.\n\n<p>This is a regular log file and would rotate normally.\n\n</p><p>The purpose of this would be catching bad, but not fatal, semantic misunderstandings in our code base. Examples follow:\n</p><ul>\n<li>calling scheduler_timeout() inside of itself produces a backtrace, but we don't EXCEPT</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:49", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Nov-16 15:32", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-16 15:32", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
