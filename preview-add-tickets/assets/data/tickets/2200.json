{"id": 2200, "title": "Ticket #2200: Improve computation of submitter limits to re-share unused slots", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, the submitter limit computations do not examine a submitter's number of jobs.  So, one can get situations where a submitter might be awarded 10 slots based on its priority, even if it only needs 5 of them to run its jobs.   The surplus will get picked up on subsequent pie spins, but it would be more efficient to enhance the submitter limit logic so that it more closely resembles the surplus quota sharing logic in hgq_allocate_surplus_loop().\n\n<p>(This could be thought of as a sort of generalization of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2194\" title='Filter \"no idle jobs\" submitters prior to phase 4.1'>#2194</a></span>)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Oct-22 14:58:32 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070901 to v070902 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-11 16:37:58 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070902 to v070903 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-22 10:54:51 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070903 to v070904 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-05 10:58:27 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070904 to v070905 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-22 11:10:10 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070905 to v070906 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Apr-22 11:10", "status": "new", "created": "2011-May-27 15:47", "fixed_version": "2011-May-27 15:47", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "eje", "derived_from": "", "creator": "eje", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "eje@cs.wisc.edu, dan@hep.wisc.edu, jrt@redhat.com, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
