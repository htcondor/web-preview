{"id": 6182, "title": "Ticket #6182: condor_q -analyze by default doesn't look at request_memory, request_*", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen running condor_q -analyze, it is only looking at the job requirements.  Things like <code>request_cpus</code>, <code>request_memory</code>, <code>request_disk</code> aren't added to the job requirements, since they are enforced at match time by the machine requirements.\n\n<p>So, some improvement is needed for this very common case.  Some ideas:\n</p><ol>\n<li>Explicitly recognize and use these attributes in the analysis.\n</li><li>Do some type of \"-reverse\" by default (maybe not on the entire pool)\n</li><li>By default require a slot ad that the user thinks \"ought to match\" and provide exact info on why it doesn't.</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Mar-10 10:35", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Mar-10 10:35", "fixed_version": "2017-Mar-10 10:35", "broken_version": "v080700", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "fermi", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
