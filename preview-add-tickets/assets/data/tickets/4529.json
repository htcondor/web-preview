{"id": 4529, "title": "Ticket #4529: No user feedback if job cannot run due to user missing on exec node", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf a job cannot be run on an execute due to the user it is trying to run as not existing, the only place where I can find that out is via the <code>StarterLog</code> on the execute node, which contains lines like:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>passwd_cache::cache_uid(): getpwnam(\"rsv\") failed: user not found\nERROR: Uid for \"rsv\" not found in passwd file and SOFT_UID_DOMAIN is False\nERROR: Failed to determine what user to run this job as, aborting\nFailed to initialize JobInfoCommunicator, aborting\nUnable to start job.\n**** condor_starter (condor_STARTER) pid 10866 EXITING WITH STATUS 1\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This does not get relayed to the user; the job just remains idle and tries to match again (possibly matching to the same machine). Is there a way that can be changed? Zach suggests the job should go on hold instead.\n\n</p><p>I tested this on a two-node setup using the OSG's RPMs, with one head node and one execute node. The user I was trying to use existed on the head node (where I was submitting from) but did not exist on the execute node. Both machines were part of the same UID_DOMAIN and FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Aug-11 18:18", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Aug-11 18:18", "fixed_version": "2014-Aug-11 18:18", "broken_version": "v080007", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "matyas", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matyas@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
