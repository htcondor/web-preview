{"id": 100, "title": "Ticket #100: Build/Test web pages: optionally hide success rows/columns", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen things are mostly good, the errors drown in a sea of success.  It's easy to overlook a lone red cell.  It's hard to line up a given error with the matching platform when it's three screens away.  Add an option \"hide success\".  This will hide any row or column that entirely consists of successful or blank results.  Rows and columns which show at least one error, or are still running, will display.  (It needs to be an option, since sometimes you need to review everything.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-21 11:03", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-23 17:12", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-23 17:12", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "#99", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
