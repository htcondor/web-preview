This duplicated work that <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DaemonCore\" title=\"Daemon Core\">DaemonCore</a></span> can do, and provides another possibility for bugs (see the first comment at <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=706\" title=\"RELEASE_CLAIM &amp; daemoncore reaper race condition\">#706</a></span> for exactly such an example).\n\n<p>Task: review the Starter's code to do this and DaemonCore's.  Merge any functionality needed by the Starter's version that's not in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DaemonCore\" title=\"Daemon Core\">DaemonCore</a></span> into <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DaemonCore\" title=\"Daemon Core\">DaemonCore</a></span>.  Change the Starter to use DaemonCore's implementation.\n\n</p><p>Assigned to psilord, whose only task is to completely replace what I've written here with a better summary based on his deeper understanding the of the situation.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Mar-30 14:14", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Oct-01 12:29", "fixed_version": "2009-Oct-01 12:29", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
