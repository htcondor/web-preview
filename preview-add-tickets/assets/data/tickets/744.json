You certainly get the error in recovery mode, but it looks like you may get pretty much the same error when you're not in recovery mode.\n\n<p>Okay, it turns out that the critical thing is the \"Job was aborted by the user\" event -- we don't get that most of the time, and that goofs up DAGMan.\n\n</p><p>This is now fixed for 7.4.0.
