At the moment the out-of-the-box default is 1.\n\n</p><p>Priority factors should be floating point numbers, so it should be possible to lower it below 1.  khahn doesn't believe this is practical, he should be consulted on why.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Sep-21 10:43:51 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe default priority factor was changed to 1000 in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=4282\" title=\"change default for accountant priority factor to 1000\">#4282</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-Sep-21 10:43", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2012-May-16 17:28", "fixed_version": "2012-May-16 17:28", "broken_version": "v070900", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
