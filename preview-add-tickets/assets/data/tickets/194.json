{"id": 194, "title": "Ticket #194: Add times to Condor specific build result reports", "description": "<blockquote>\nAdding durations to our build result reports would make identifying surprising changes easier.  It's a crude tool, but seeing a test run that normally takes 2 hours take 4 is cause for investigation.  Specific points to investigate:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://nmi-s006.cs.wisc.edu/results/Run-condor.php\">Condor Latest Build/Test Results</a>: Add duration below \"Failed 0\" line.  Not all that useful, but for consistency with other pages.\n</li><li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://nmi-s006.cs.wisc.edu/results/Run-condor-branch.php?branch=trunk&amp;user=cndrauto\">A single branch</a>: Add duration below \"Failed 0\" line.  More useful, as you can compare durations over time/builds.\n</li><li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://nmi-s006.cs.wisc.edu/results/Run-condor-details.php?runid=130515&amp;type=test&amp;user=cndrauto\">expanded results</a>: Add a row at the very end or very top \"Duration\".  Not quite as useful, but for consistency.\n</li><li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://nmi-s006.cs.wisc.edu/results/Test-history.php?branch=trunk&amp;test=cmd_q_shows-global-1\">Test history</a>: This should probably be an option that, when turned on, replaces the exit codes with duration.  Very useful for identifying a sudden spike in a given test's duration.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-21 11:01", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Feb-06 17:28", "fixed_version": "2009-Feb-06 17:28", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
