If you\nremember, our participation with this program will be highly dependent on\nHTCondor's ability to integrate with unix groups so that we can automatically\nadd ProjectName to submit files for our users.\n\nBest,\nLauren Michael\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 28, 2014 at 2:29 PM, Tanya Levshina &lt;@fnal.gov&gt; wrote:\n\n    Hi Lauren,\n\n    We haven't somehow followed up on our discussion about GLOW project name\n    reporting. For now we have several campuses reporting Project Names and we\n    are able to generate various reports based on this information. The project\n    names are registered in OIM and are associated with a specific Campus (see\n    for example https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/campusgrid?id=14 or https://\n    oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/campusgrid?id=15). The project name should be an unique\n    name for now.\n\n    Miron has asked me to start sending him sites report related to GLOW (see\n    below) but it would be also great if we can split the usage further down by\n    project and science field.\n\n    Are you planning to revisit this topic?\n\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-May-21 10:33", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Feb-26 11:37", "fixed_version": "2014-Feb-26 11:37", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "lmichael@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
