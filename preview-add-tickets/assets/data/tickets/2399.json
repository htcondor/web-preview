The fix for 7.6.3 was to disallow this combination, as a proper fix was deemed too invasive for a stable release. In the development series, we should consider a proper fix that allows these options to work together properly.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Aug-18 08:51", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Aug-18 08:51", "fixed_version": "2011-Aug-18 08:51", "broken_version": "v070603", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#2398", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
