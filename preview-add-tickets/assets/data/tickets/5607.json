All new LIGO usernames are in this format.\n\n<p>People argued about the period. It's here. We also have dashes. Mostly for Europeans, e.g.\n\n</p><p>laura.van-der-schaaf\n\n</p><p>These names don't get correctly reported by condor_gangliad. The above appears as, for example, \"laura Total Running Jobs\" under the HTCondor.Accounting.Groups metrics of the collector/negotiator.\n\n</p><p>For starters, we are not using accounting groups so I'm not sure it should be reported. But if so, it should be accurate.\n\n</p><p>The section HTCondor.Submitters accurately reports the name above as laura.van-der-schaaf@nemo.phys.uwm.edu</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2016-Apr-07 00:31", "status": "defer", "created": "2016-Apr-07 00:31", "fixed_version": "2016-Apr-07 00:31", "broken_version": "v080503", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tpdownes", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
