{"id": 3861, "title": "Ticket #3861: automatically detect NVIDIA/CUDA GPU resources", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis can be an inventory discovery script as outlined in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"tktview?tn=2905\" title=\"RFE: adding local resource limits to partionable slots\">#2905</a></span> or another mechanism, but the goal is to avoid the need for Condor administrators to manually configure NVIDIA GPU resources and CUDA environment variables.\n\n<p>This will make life easier for administrators -- but equally importantly, it will establish a consistent naming scheme for users to address these resources.  (E.g., right now on the LDG, every site has its own bespoke GPU naming and environmental conventions users have to sort out.)\n\n</p><p>[Note: <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"tktview?tn=3862\" title=\"automatically detect Intel MIC resources\">#3862</a></span> is an equivalent ticket for Intel MIC resources.]</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Sep-21 11:42", "status": "defer", "created": "2013-Aug-20 08:59", "fixed_version": "2013-Aug-20 08:59", "broken_version": "v080100", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#2905", "creator": "pfc", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pfcouvar@syr.edu, anderson@ligo.caltech.edu, carsten.aulbert@aei.mpg.de, tpdownes@gravity.phys.uwm.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
