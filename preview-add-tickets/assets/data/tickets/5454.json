We'd want to detect if the platform provides a native one, which is likely to be better, especially on mobile platforms. We could use Moderizr to detect the availability.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Dec-23 15:46:26 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nTook the technique Modernizr uses to set Modernizr.inputtypes.date and reimplemented. This is only a reasonable solution because we want one very small feature. The result is smaller and faster (because even doing a custom Modernizr build, it will test for other input types we don't care about).  If we start caring about more options, we should just use Modernizr.\n\n<p>In short: If we can't set the input's type to \"date\", or it will accept an invalid date, then the platform doesn't support it.\n\n</p><p>If there is not native date picker, we use jQueryUI's.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Dec-23 15:43</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=48018\">[48018]</a></span>: Provide fallback date picker if browser doesn't <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=5454\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5454'); return false;\" title=\"HTCondor View: Add a date picker\">#5454</a></span>  (By Alan De Smet )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2015-Dec-23 16:12", "status": "resolved", "created": "2015-Dec-23 15:41", "fixed_version": "2015-Dec-23 15:41", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "#5351", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
