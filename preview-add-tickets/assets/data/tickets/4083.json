{"id": 4083, "title": "Ticket #4083: All tests should explicitly set desired DAEMON_LIST", "description": "<blockquote>\nAll tests should set their desired DAEMON_LIST, or at least (perhaps in CondorPersonal.pm) ensure that the default is set to \"MASTER,COLLECTOR,NEGOTIATOR,SCHEDD,STARTD\".  If a test just assumes that the template file is correct, it may fail if the system has chosen as a template file an unusually configured one.  This wouldn't be a problem if it explicitly got the template file from condor_examples, but the current scripts nose around looking for a working install to swipe from.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Nov-18 18:03", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Nov-18 18:03", "fixed_version": "2013-Nov-18 18:03", "broken_version": "v080102", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
