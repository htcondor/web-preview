{"id": 3966, "title": "Ticket #3966: No definition of local universe in condor_submit manpage", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe condor_submit documentation mentions but does not define local universe. Here is the 8.1.1 text for \"universe\" in the condor_submit manpage today:\n\n<p>Specifies which HTCondor Universe to use when running this job. The HTCondor Universe specifies an HTCondor execution environment. The standard Universe tells HTCondor that this job has been re-linked via condor_compile with the HTCondor libraries and therefore supports checkpointing and remote system calls. The vanilla Universe is the default (except where the configuration variable DEFAULT_UNIVERSE defines it otherwise), and is an execution environment for jobs which have not been linked with the HTCondor libraries. Note: Use the vanilla Universe to submit shell scripts to HTCondor. The scheduler is for a job that should act as a metascheduler. The grid universe forwards the job to an external job management system. Further specification of the grid universe is done with the grid_resource command. The java universe is for programs written to the Java Virtual Machine. The vm universe facilitates the execution of a virtual machine.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Oct-04 12:59</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=37773\">[37773]</a></span>: improve prose describing universe on the condor_submit man page, and include description of the local universe (previously missing) <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3966\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3966'); return false;\" title=\"No definition of local universe in condor_submit manpage\">#3966</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2013-Oct-04 13:05", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Oct-03 12:53", "fixed_version": "2013-Oct-03 12:53", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "cat", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "cat@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
