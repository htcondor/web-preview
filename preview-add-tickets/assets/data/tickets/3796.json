This involves two sub-tasks:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>Verify that all the new GLIBC213 #defines make sense.\n</li><li>Use (understand and update) the analyze_syscalls script (or something similar); add doing so to the full port instructions.  Document which functions which ignored and why, if possible.  Add analyze_syscalls to the other full port pages on the wiki so it won't be forgotten again.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Feb-06 17:42:18 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nReview of #defines completed as part of the RHEL 7 port.\n\n<p>Still need to do the analyze_syscalls work.\n\n</p><p><em>2018-Mar-01 14:32:09 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nStandard universe has been in maintenance-only mode for some time, abandoning.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2018-Mar-01 14:34", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2013-Jul-22 17:43", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-22 17:43", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Std", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
