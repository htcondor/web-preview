If\na job is submitted from a directory which does not allow group\nor other read or execute access (or if any directories in the\npath to this directory do not allow such access), then an\nattempt to open a file from within a Fortran code fails with\nthe complaint:\n\n</p><p>open: Permission denied\n\"\n\n</p><p>He is reading the files from fortran programs compiled for standard universe.
