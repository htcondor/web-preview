The schedd log indicates Condor version '11/01/10 14:31:09 ** $CondorVersion: 7.5.4 Oct 18 2010 BuildID: 280908 $'.  More precisely, I'd submitted a bunch (four or five) recurring runs (that were spawning new Metronome jobs at the rate of once a minute), each of which (due to a bug I was fixing) also spawned a once-every-other-minute local universe job (to send mail).  I'm guessing that it took long enough to remove all the jobs that one of them died while the schedd was removing jobs (and not paying attention to them).\n\n</p><p>I have not attempted to reproduce.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Nov-01 15:03:48 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nMade it happen again (by accident) while continuing debug.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:50:47 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:20:02 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:20", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Nov-01 14:42", "fixed_version": "2010-Nov-01 14:42", "broken_version": "v070504", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
