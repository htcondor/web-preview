{"id": 3721, "title": "Ticket #3721: update curl external", "description": "<blockquote>\n<strong>NOTE</strong> This would appear to be a security problem, but in reality is mitigated by a number of factors.\n\n<p>(CVE-2013-2174)  <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0983.html\">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0983.html</a>\n\n</p><p>curl has a buffer overflow attack that could allow arbitrary code execution, and since file transfer plugins do run with privilege, this could allow a submitter to escalate their own privilege on an execute machine.\n\n</p><p>However, because HTCondor dynamically links curl, it is up to the machine owner to provide an updated curl library.  This is true for the Linux and MacOS platforms we currently support.  On Windows, the curl_plugin is not currently included in the distribution (it should be, but that's a separate issue).\n\n</p><p>We should still upgrade the external for people who are compiling from scratch on systems without libcurl.  However, this issue will not cause a special security release.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jun-26 13:58</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=36690\">[36690]</a></span>: upgrade curl external <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3721\" title=\"update curl external\">#3721</a></span>  (By Zach Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jun-26 14:00", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Jun-25 16:54", "fixed_version": "2013-Jun-25 16:54", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
