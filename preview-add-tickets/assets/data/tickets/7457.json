{"id": 7457, "title": "Ticket #7457: merge old-inotify patch from Python distributions", "description": "<blockquote>\nJason Patton has been maintaining a small patch required to build the Python bindings for pip -- HTCondor uses a newer inotify interface than the build container supports.  Changes to the inotify code (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=7373\" title=\"condor_wait doesn't fall back on polling when inotify fails\">#7373</a></span>) caused the patch not to apply.  While this should have been noticed earlier in the release process, it could have caused the release to have been delayed.\n\n<p>Merging the patch into the mainline should prevent this problem from reoccurring, as well as simplify building the bindings for pip.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Jan-01 13:52:31 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nI boldly claim this will have no user-visible effect, and as such, does not require documentation.
