It appears that the machine is being fork-bombed. I see many 'make' processes owned by sl1-user running, and all virtual memory exhausted. It appears that said job was submitted from nmi-s006, I'm doing some more digging.\n\n<p>It's definitely Condor build jobs. The one that was running when it went down last was associated with run 294162, which is a build of tag trunk-2010-11-28.\n\n</p><p>Looks like it happened again last night, too.  Machine went down at 23:13:53,\nwith 3089 processes and Swap:  747012k av,  747012k used,       0k free (all\nfrom 'top' which I had running).\n\n</p><p>I now have a 'watch -n 30 \"ps auxww|grep make\"' running on this machine in an attempt to help track down what's going on.\n\n</p><p>-Nick</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nNo longer applies.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-May-24 14:44", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2010-Dec-03 11:15", "fixed_version": "2010-Dec-03 11:15", "broken_version": "v070505", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "nleroy", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
