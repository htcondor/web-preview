They indicate how much of each machine resource has been allocated to the job. For statically partitioned slots, they will match the amount of resource given to the slot when the startd started. For partitionable slots, they will be based on the job\u2019s <code>Request&lt;name&gt;</code> attributes, but may be larger to make the partitioned slot more likely to be reusable for additional jobs. In all cases, they should be equal to or greater than the job\u2019s <code>Request&lt;name&gt;</code> attributes.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Jan-12 10:52</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=42165\">[42165]</a></span>: add definitions of some missing job attributes (that are in the job's <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> on the execute machine as the job runs, but not in the schedd) <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=4170\" title=\"missing job ClassAd attributes in the manual\">#4170</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2015-Jan-12 10:55", "status": "resolved", "created": "2014-Jan-23 08:37", "fixed_version": "2014-Jan-23 08:37", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
