{"id": 5033, "title": "Ticket #5033: Have classad attribute identifying all jobs in a workflow", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe should have some <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> attribute that's the same for all jobs in a workflow, no matter how deeply nested (including the top-level DAGMan job itself).  (DAGManJobId only has the job's immediate parent, so if you have more than one level of nested DAG it won't work; and the top-level DAGMan job itself doesn't have this attribute.)\n\n<p>Maybe it could be something like TopLevelDAGManJobId or <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=WorkflowId\" title=\"Workflow Id\">WorkflowId</a></span>?  Or maybe we could use the upcoming <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=BatchName\" title=\"Batch Name\">BatchName</a></span> feature?\n\n</p><p>At any rate, the idea is to have an attribute that could be used in a constraint to condor_q, etc., that would get you <strong>all</strong> jobs in a given workflow.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Dec-17 15:36:30 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nAlso see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"tktview?tn=5444\" title=\"Allow user to specify a workflow name\">#5444</a></span>.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Jan-27 13:51:19 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nEverything in this ticket is now incorporated in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5490\" title=\"add a -batch-name argument to condor_submit and condor_submit_dag\">#5490</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5493\" title=\"Propagate batch-name to all jobs in a workflow\">#5493</a></span>, and <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5494\" title=\"Create a test for -batch-name\">#5494</a></span>, so I'm going to mark this ticket as abandoned.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jan-27 13:51", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2015-Apr-29 12:00", "fixed_version": "2015-Apr-29 12:00", "broken_version": "v080305", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
