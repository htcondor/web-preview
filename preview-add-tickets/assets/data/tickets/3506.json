{"id": 3506, "title": "Ticket #3506: Master should restart all daemons when network address changes", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf a machine's IP address changes, all Condor daemons on that machine can no longer be contacted, even from tools or daemons on that same machine. This situation is very likely to occur on laptops, which frequently move between different wired and wireless networks. BOSCO is making Condor installations on laptops more common, so addressing this problem is becoming more important.\n\n<p>The condor_master should periodically examine the IP addresses of the local machine and restart all of the daemons (including itself) if it detects a change. The master already does this for substantial jumps in the system clock.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Mar-13 14:12:02 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nBaTLab is also having chronic problems with distributions lying (or being mistaken) about their network being ready during startup.  This causes the master to start up on 127.0.0.1, and, among other problems, reject DC_CHILDALIVE because the daemon in question is using the execute node's public IP.

It seems like it should be easy to work around your particular situation -- if the master can't find an\ninterface to bind to, it should sleep for a while and then restart.\n\n<p>For the laptop case (and a few others), it would be convenient to have a blacklist (e.g., I know I /don't/ want loopback or any of the VM interfaces, but I could be using eth0 or wlan0, or maybe usb0, and I have no idea what the IP might be, and it could be a private address).</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"attach_get/687/NetworkAddressMonitoring.doc\">NetworkAddressMonitoring.doc</a>\n26112 bytes added by jfrey on 2013-Feb-21 21:25:46 UTC.\n<br/>\nDesign document for master monitoring of network address.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Jul-10 14:34", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Feb-21 11:59", "fixed_version": "2013-Feb-21 11:59", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, adesmet@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
