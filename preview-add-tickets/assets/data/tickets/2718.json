Identify why.  If it is possible to happen, then the message need to be improved.\n\n</p><p>Working theory: A race condition in how Condor polls for processes.  Condor learns about process X.  Process X exits.  Condor polls process X, failing.  A large stream of extremely short running jobs (perhaps vanilla, scheduler, or local) might trigger this.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Dec-15 11:03", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Dec-15 11:03", "fixed_version": "2011-Dec-15 11:03", "broken_version": "v070603", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
