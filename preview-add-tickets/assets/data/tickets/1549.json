{"id": 1549, "title": "Ticket #1549: New Classads should not support octal integer literals", "description": "<blockquote>\nNew Classads supports octal integer literals, indicated by a leading zero.  Old classads did not support this.  We have no way to print out octal literals.  More importantly, this is bound to surprise some user who accidentally enters a classad value with a leading zero, perhaps for formatting reasons.  New classads also supports hex literals, but this is less of a problem, as no one is going to accidentally type in a leading 0x, and expect a decimal value.\n\n<p>Let's drop support for octal, sorry pdp-11 lovers.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Aug-02 14:28:01 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe first step is to disable parsing of octal and hex integers when in old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> emulation mode.
