{"id": 1963, "title": "Ticket #1963: Failure to write a UserLog event is not fatal", "description": "<blockquote>\nWith the v7.5.6 release candidate, on CHTC we have observed jobs running to completion and leaving the queue, and yet both the global and job event logs only have a running event - no execute or terminate event.\n\n<p>One big problem is the shadow does nothing beyond a dprintf when writing a user log event fails.  For example, when writing the job terminate event log fails, the shadow just does a dprintf and then merrily tells the schedd everything was fine, and the schedd then removes the job from the queue.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Mar-11 17:48:23 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nCommit <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=21031\">[21031]</a></span> was code reviewed by gthain - pushed into v7.5.6-branch.

Interesting shadow log snippet attached to this ticket. What we see is Shadow's attempting to grab the lock on the global event log, and chronically failing to do so for a period of a few seconds apparently because the underlying call to <code>fcntl()</code> is failing. When the underlying fcntl fails, apparently we ultimately fail to log the event anywhere. Our handling of fcntl failures is apparently not very robust.\n\n<p>Note this brief period of locking failures did not happen while the global event log was being rotated, so the rotation code is in the clear for the moment.\n\n</p><p>This may not be a regression. The lock failures appeared to happen grabbing the lock on the global event log (lots of shadows all locking the same file), and happened when there was a flood of events to log (many job evictions happened at the same time for some reason). The global event log has only been enabled on CHTC since end of Dec.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-06 08:45:03 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nGregT, please code review <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=21277\">[21277]</a></span> and <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=21278\">[21278]</a></span>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-06 14:09:23 by cweiss:</em> <br/>\n\nA comment concerning changes in file_lock.unix.cpp:\n\n<p>For the non-blocking case we loop w/o an additional break condition in case of &amp;#8203;EINTR.
