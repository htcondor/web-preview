{"id": 6570, "title": "Ticket #6570: Should user log report Resource(.*)Usage attributes?", "description": "<blockquote>\nAt some point in the near future, we expect to start reporting GPUsMemoryUsage (a peak metric) in the same way we currently report GPUsUsage.  However, this attribute will not be automatically picked up by the user log usage report code, since the provisioned resource is 'GPUs', not 'GPUsMemory'.  This is easy enough to fix (conceptually, with the regex in the ticket title), but since GPUsMemory -- at least for now -- can't be (meaningfully) requested, assigned, or allocated, adding another row to the usage table won't be a good use of space.\n\n<p>Instead, we should consider a \"paragraph\" of these additional attributes, identified by the same regex and printed out after everything currently in the usage report (but before the record separator, so we don't break existing parsing code).  The format could be as simple as\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>Name = Value[, Name = Value]*\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>where each <code>Name</code> is one of the nonempty matches to the regex.  (Would we have to break the paragraph at 80 columns?)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-Feb-14 09:46", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Feb-14 09:46", "fixed_version": "2018-Feb-14 09:46", "broken_version": "v080707", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
