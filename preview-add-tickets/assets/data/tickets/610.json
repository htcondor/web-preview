About a dozen stork jobs that completed around the time of the crashes left Stork's queue but no entry was written to their user logs. This caused the DAGs they were a part of to stall indefinitely.\n\n<p>The logging code in Stork needs to be reviewed to ensure that jobs that leave the queue always have a log event written.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jan-30 14:08:39 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nAbandoning, since Stork is no longer maintained as part of Condor.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:08", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Jul-02 13:42", "fixed_version": "2009-Jul-02 13:42", "broken_version": "v070203", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
