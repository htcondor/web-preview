{"id": 3307, "title": "Ticket #3307: Condor build using Visual Studio 2012", "description": "<blockquote>\nWith VS2012 out and the express version including the runtime manifests, it's a good chance to work on support for building HTCondor in VS2012. So far problems encountered include the linker pulling in way more than it should, in part due to the merger of daemon core and the util library. This causes soap dependencies to throw linker errors in condor_setup, which have been worked around by stubbing the offending functions in condor_setup.\n\n<p>One bonus to using VS2012 is not needing boost anymore. VS2012 includes all of the C++ 11 functionality that we use in the classad code.\n\n</p><p>Installer also needs some minor updates. Specifically, the VC++2012 runtime uses Windows Installer 4.5, whereas we are still set to 3.0. This may not require anything beyond an update to WiX and setting the value appropriately in the wix files.\n\n</p><p>We do need to check whether the VS2012 build will work correctly on XP. Microsoft has released an update to allow for XP targeting, just need to confirm that it works.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Nov-12 15:01</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=34083\">[34083]</a></span>: Change Windows Installer version to 4.5 for compatibility with VS2012 runtime merge module.
