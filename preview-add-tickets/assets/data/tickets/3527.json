{"id": 3527, "title": "Ticket #3527: condor_negotiator wegding when MPI jobs are in queue", "description": "<blockquote>\nI apologize in advance for lacking all the details you might need to debug this, but Greg encouraged me to submit anyway.\n\n<p>What I know is simply this: when one specific user submitted a specific batch of MPI jobs, the negotiator reliably and repeatedly wedged and had to be killed by the master (~10 times/day).  When the jobs were removed, this stopped happening.  It seemed 100% correlated.\n\n</p><p>Prior to the Negotiator wedging there is nothing visibly amiss in its own log.  Then the Master reports the following:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>02/20/13 11:13:16 ERROR: Child pid 9024 appears hung!

Is the answer:\n\n<p>* Condor can't and won't handle 100 8-way MPI jobs being submitted at once so tell users to never do that (\"Doctor, my hurts when I bang it against the wall\")?\n\n</p><p>* Increase the speed with which the negotiator hands out these matches (how?)\n\n</p><p>* Throttle the negotiation process somehow when submit lots of MPI jobs (how?)\n\n</p><p>* Something else?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-11 15:00:00 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nSorry about that -- we had talked about this here, but I guess I never sent you an update.\n\n<p>To fix the immediate problem, let's turn on the negotiator throttles -- let's set\n\n</p><p>NEGOTIATOR_MAX_TIME_PER_PIESPIN\nand\nNEGOTIATOR_MAX_TIME_PER_SUBMITTER\n\n</p><p>down to something like 40 minutes.
