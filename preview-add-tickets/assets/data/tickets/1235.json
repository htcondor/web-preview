{"id": 1235, "title": "Ticket #1235: Allow variables in log file names for DAG nodes", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt really would be nice to allow variables in the log file specifications for DAG node jobs.  Right now we don't allow variables at all because that's the easiest way to avoid $(cluster), $(proc), and $(subproc), which we <em>can't</em> allow because they would break recovery mode.\n\n<p>Note: right now, if you have a variable in your log file name, the log file finding code fails on that, but then DAGMan continues and tries to use the default log file for that node.  This should probably actually be a fatal error.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Nov-17 12:36:58 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is essentially a duplicate of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2428\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2428'); return false;\" title=\"allow macros in dagman log files to assist templating\">#2428</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Nov-17 12:37", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2010-Feb-19 10:06", "fixed_version": "2010-Feb-19 10:06", "broken_version": "v070501", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
