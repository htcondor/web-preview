{"id": 3874, "title": "Ticket #3874: No event in user log about master killing hung startd", "description": "<blockquote>\nPete Keller writes:\n\n<p></p><pre>  But, the problem basically is, in 7.8.2 condor on an debian x86_64\n  machine, if the master thinks the startd is hung and kills it, the job\n  goes to idle, but there is no event in the user log about it. This was\n  very surprising.\n</pre>\n\n<p></p><pre>  The logs are uninteresting and I can't tell what the startd was doing\n  when the master thought it was hung. Maybe the master should explain\n  what method it tried whyen it discovered it was hung, like couldn't\n  connect to it, or a signal send had a bad return code, etc.\n</pre>\n\n<p>See the linked condor-admin ticket for the output of 'condor_gather _info'.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Aug-28 12:38:24 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nAsked Pete to clarify the sequence of events.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2013-Aug-28 12:38", "status": "pending", "created": "2013-Aug-27 14:15", "fixed_version": "2013-Aug-27 14:15", "broken_version": "v070802", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "a25953", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
