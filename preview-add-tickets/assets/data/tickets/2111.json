(Do the config values get put into the job's environment or something like that?)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-May-02 15:36:24 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nWhy is this a defect?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-May-02 16:24:09 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nWell, if you have a complex workflow, I don't think that, say, the maxjobs setting for the top-level DAG is necessarily appropriate for the sub-DAGs.  Also, things are currently inconsistent between config settings/environment variables and command-line flags as to which are propagated to lower-level DAGs.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2014-May-11 21:08", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Apr-28 11:06", "fixed_version": "2011-Apr-28 11:06", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
