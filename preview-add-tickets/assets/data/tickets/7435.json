The RPATH needs to be updated to look two directories up, instead of just one.\n\n<p>This problem can be worked around by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the condor <code>lib</code> directory.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Dec-17 10:59</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=58673\">[58673]</a></span>: Docs for python bindings rpath fix. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=7435\" title=\"Fix RPATH for Python bindings in tarball\">#7435</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Dec-16 16:33</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=58667\">[58667]</a></span>: Fix PYTHON_RPATH for tarball builds. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=7435\" title=\"Fix RPATH for Python bindings in tarball\">#7435</a></span> Since the python shared libraries were moved one directory down, they need to look one directory further up to find their dependencies.
