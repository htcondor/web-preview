I've not seen any user hit this, luckily.\n\n</p><p>I suggest we have special logic to log this case in BIG BOLD LETTERS</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-May-11 07:45:41 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nWe should version the utils library similar to classads.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-May-11 07:52:32 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Tim,\n\n<p>Well - I lost the battle for keeping (what I consider) proper shared lib versioning for libcondor_utils.  We now do:\n\n</p><p>libcondor_utils_7_9_0.so\n\n</p><p>(huh - I just noticed that we don't do the normal .so / .so.0 / .so.0.0.0 setup)\n\n</p><p><strong>However</strong>, this ticket is tackling the edge cases of folks dropping binaries in place that don't belong.\n\n</p><p>For example, I set\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>DEV_CONDOR = /home/cse496/bbockelm/projects/condor\nSCHEDD = $(DEV_CONDOR)/src/condor_schedd.V6/condor_schedd\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and sometimes the resulting schedd doesn't link correctly to the system library.\n\n</p><p>I think it's pretty rare - and <strong>strongly</strong> discouraged - for users to do something like this.  It's a piece of developer silliness, but a piece of silliness that has cost real time.\n\n</p><p>Brian</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2012-May-11 09:57", "status": "new", "created": "2012-May-10 18:45", "fixed_version": "2012-May-10 18:45", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
