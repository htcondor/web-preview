{"id": 947, "title": "Ticket #947: Remove NEGOTIATOR_SIMPLE_MATCHING", "description": "<blockquote>\nSetting config param NEGOTIATOR_SIMPLE_MATCHING to True causes machine ads to be referenced after deletion in the negotiator. It also causes some machine ad munging related to <span class=\"quote\">WantAdRevaluate</span> and <span class=\"quote\">NegotiatorRequirements</span> to be skipped.\n\n<p>This parameter was added specifically for Micron 5 years ago, whose negotiator was being slowed down too much by the negotiator grabbing all ads from the collector, rather than just startd and submitter ads. Back then, the collector was changed to pull all ads in order to support gangmatching-lite. Gangmatching-lite is no longer in the code-base and the extra ads are now ignored.\n\n</p><p>NEGOTIATOR_SIMPLE_MATCHING has never been documented. If we assume Micron has a modern machine for their central manager, we can remove the NEGOTIATOR_SIMPLE_MATCHING code. At some point, we may want to reconsider whether the negotiator should be grabbing all ads from the collector.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Nov-14 21:59:04 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed a fix to V7_4-branch for 7.4.1.
