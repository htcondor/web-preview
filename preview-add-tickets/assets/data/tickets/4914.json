I'm not sure why this wasn't back-ported.\n\n</p><p>This would be useful for testing on laptops, in particular.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Feb-26 10:33", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Feb-26 10:33", "fixed_version": "2015-Feb-26 10:33", "broken_version": "v080203", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonMaster", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
