In the case of IP-based security, none of the default authentication methods (FS, GSI, etc) work over the network without additional setup from the admin.  By appending CLAIMTOBE to the to the READ authentication methods, we essentially tell the schedd to assume the user running \"condor_q\" is the same as whoami reports on the remote machine if the user cannot be authenticated any other way.   Zach needs to add this logic into the code, because we do NOT want to do this if, for instance, the admin explicitly sets up a more restrictive READ policy, but hopefully it gives you the idea for how to work around this right now.  Hopefully Zach can have this added for v8.6.1.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Feb-02 12:24:57 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nIt may be lost in the noise, but the way you read certificates and validate their hostnames is, very literally, not what the specification tells you to do. To workaround your choice, you've added a lot of knobs to allow one certificate to stand-in for other hotsnames that aren't in the certificate subject.\n\n<p>GSI_SKIP_HOST_CHECK_CERT_REGEX,GSI_SKIP_HOST_CHECK,HOST_ALIAS\n\n</p><p>But, in 2017, certificates have these features built-in. This is one of the ways that the world of high-availability on the web works - a certificate can represent many FQDNs easily with subject alternative names and wildcards. See, e.g. the cert from www.nytimes.com.\n\n</p><p>Maybe, long ago, you needed these knobs. Now they're very much in the way of security.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Feb-02 12:41:45 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nImmediately previous comment (related to cleanup cert alternative names) is, IMO, very valid.... but really should be in a separate ticket.\n\n<p>Lets keep this ticket on the topic of how to improve the out-of-box experience, as currently \"condor_q\" fails against a remote schedd but works if you do \"condor_q -allusers\".\n\n</p><p>I suggest all the comments/wisdom related to modernization of how cert alternative names are handled moves to a different ticket.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Feb-03 11:17:05 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nI created a new ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"tktview?tn=6125\" title=\"default condor_q behavior in 8.6.0 has issues (-global)\">#6125</a></span> that address the proposed fix for this problem.
