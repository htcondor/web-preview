In that fix, we transferred the correct file for the job executable, but gave it the wrong name. The file that we put on the CREAM server had the name of the file in the spool directory, but the filename we told CREAM to run came from the Cmd attribute of the job ad.\n\n<p>Now, when we transfer the executable, the destination filename matches the Cmd attribute.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Jun-09 10:32</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=40367\">[40367]</a></span>: super minor 8.2.0 version history item edit <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=4391\" title=\"Cream jobs with spooled executable fail at startup\">#4391</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-May-30 10:57</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=40283\">[40283]</a></span>: Cream jobs with spooled executable fail at startup. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=4391\" title=\"Cream jobs with spooled executable fail at startup\">#4391</a></span> When copy_to_spool=True, we used inconsistent filenames for the job executable on the CREAM server.
