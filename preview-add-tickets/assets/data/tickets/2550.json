This is a regression since the 7.4 series and was introduced, as far as I can tell, with the spool directory reorganization in the 7.5.5 timeframe.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Oct-19 08:38:01 by willb:</em> <br/>\n\nDan reviewed the attached patch.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Oct-14 17:05</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=27848\">[27848]</a></span>: The schedd will no longer attempt to remove job sandbox directories that do not exist. ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2550\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2550'); return false;\" title=\"unnecessary spool interaction during job removal and completion\">#2550</a></span> ===BZ=== 703992  (By Will Benton )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Oct-19 08:38", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Oct-14 11:43", "fixed_version": "2011-Oct-14 11:43", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "willb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "willb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
