The code pieces we don't want now can continue to live on Carl's branch.  Thanks.\n\n<p><em>2017-Aug-03 13:58:00 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nUpdated. I'll deal with the shared port stuff in a different ticket then. Also included a line item to update the hashing function like we discussed.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Aug-03 16:40:34 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nOne thing I'm finding confusing with Carl's code: whenever the public file transfers are misconfigured (ie. wrong web server address, webroot not defined, etc.) it silently falls back to a CEDAR transfer. This doesn't seem like desirable behavior to me. A user could easily make a configuration error, then send massive amounts of data over CEDAR without ever realizing it.\n\n<p>A couple different options here:\n\n</p><p>1) Preserve the existing behavior but add error messages to the logs.\n\n</p><p>2) In the event of a configuration error, hold the job. Same behavior as when there are problems with transfer_input_files. Force the user to fix the problem before moving on.\n\n</p><p>Any thoughts, other ideas?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Aug-03 18:55:34 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nLet's be clear about the distinction between \"users\" and \"HTCondor sysadmin\".\n\n<p>It's the sysadmin that does the configuration.\n\n</p><p>It's the user that specifies the submit file.\n\n</p><p>So putting the job on hold due to the sysadmin's error may not be helpful since the user can't do anything about it (other than complain to their sysadmin). Really, they just want the job to run and probably don't care too much how the file gets there, which is why Carl decided to just falling back to transferring it via CEDAR.\n\n</p><p>That said, this failure shouldn't happen silently.  I'd suggest we log something via dprintf(D_ALWAYS, \"ERROR: ...\") but still let the job run, or in a more extreme version we EXCEPT() so that we get the sysadmin's attention right away.\n\n</p><p>The incentive for users to use the \"public_input_files\" feature is just that they get to run their jobs more quickly in theory.  But I'm sure they'd rather have them run slowly than not at all, and it's the sysadmin who should be concerned about good utilization of the network and caches.  My $0.02.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Aug-11 10:36:22 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nRe item  10 above that says\n\n<p></p><pre>  \"Shadow should use root privileges to store the hash links, so web_root_dir doesn't need to be 777\"\n</pre>\n\n<p>Why root? Isn't root a really big hammer for this?  Also, if your web_root_dir is on a shared file system like NFS (which is likely to be pretty common if folks want to run their web server on a different machine from their schedd), root squash will make writing the links as root a really bad choice.\n\n</p><p>Isn't condor privileges good enough?\n\n</p><p>Or maybe even better, allow a config knob to specify the user to use when writing to web_root_dir ?  (and maybe 'condor' could server as a reasonable default here)\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Aug-14 11:25:41 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nResponding to Todd regarding item 10.\n\n<p>Sorry for the confusion here.  In the original version of the code, the links were written as the user running the job.  This meant that the directory used for web_root_dir had to be chmod 777 (or 1777 perhaps).  I did not want to make a world-writable directory necessary for this feature to work which is why I raised this issue initially.\n\n</p><p>My idea was to have HTCondor use root to create the link and then change the ownership to the user, so that the directory could be locked down to something chmod 755.  This is the exact same approach we take for creating spool and execute directories for a user, where the \"execute\" dir itself is owned by \"condor\" but each subdir/sandbox is owned by the user.  That doesn't seem like an outrageously \"big hammer\", it follows our existing model, and it helps make it trivially obvious to the admin which users are using public_input_files since the symlinks would have their ownership.\n\n</p><p>As Todd mentioned, that does run into potential trouble with NFS and root_squash, though.  In general, that seems like an odd configuration since you wouldn't be able to (usefully) link to local files on the submit machine if the httpd server is running on a different machine.  It would only work if you linked to files that were also already in NFS and probably already available via NFS on the execute machine, since that IMHO is the most common reason to have NFS or other shared filesystems deployed.  If these public input files are in NFS, the shadow needs to read the entirety of each file over the network just to calculate the hash, then the web server needs to read the entire thing from the NFS server, and then send it yet again over the network to the execute machine.  Doesn't seem terribly efficient, especially given that the ostensible goal of this work is to reduce the amount of times we transfer files to ease the load on the network.\n\n</p><p>The design doc doesn't specify allowing a third-party (separate host using shared filesystem) web server explicitly, and definitely seems to make the assumption that the web server is running on the same host as the schedd/shadow (with references to linking to local files, having the shadow potentially be the server, navigating shared port, etc.).\n\n</p><p>Despite all those caveats, supporting that \"split server\" mode is not difficult to add to the design.  In that case, the web_root_dir can, as Todd suggested, simply be owned by \"condor\" (or some other configurable user, perhaps \"httpd\") and the links inside web_root_dir can be created as the same user.  All the files pointed to are already required (and checked) to be world-readable anyways.\n\n</p><p>So let's create a new knob, \"HTTP_PUBLIC_FILES_USER\", which defaults to the user that is running condor.  Typically this is \"condor\" but if the admin has changed this using CONDOR_IDS then we should honor that piece of configuration.  To that end, I propose that the value of this knob can either be set to:\n</p><ul>\n<li>a raw username, like \"httpd\" or \"nobody\", or I guess a raw UID, like 1377.\n</li><li>The token \"&lt;condor&gt;\" (case insensitive) which means the same user as the condor daemons run as.\n</li><li>The token \"&lt;user&gt;\" (also case insensitive) which means the user who submitted the job.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>The default could then be \"&lt;condor&gt;\"... (or \"&lt;user&gt;\"?)\n\n</p><p>Any problems with that?  It allows as much flexibility as I think anyone would ever need for both regular and NFS deployments.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Aug-14 14:18:38 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nIf we decide to go with my proposal, I now have code to do exactly that.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Aug-15 13:53:07 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nI just went ahead and committed my code yesterday to fix issue 10 as described in my previous comment.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Oct-17 12:24:32 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nHi all, this work is implemented and documented, so I'm going to mark this as resolved.
