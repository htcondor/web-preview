{"id": 1424, "title": "Ticket #1424: Add exists() function to ClassAds", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn the <span class=\"quote\">ClassAd</span> language, it is impossible to check for the existence of an attribute in an ad. You cannot distinguish between the absence of an attribute and the presence of that attribute with a value of <code>Undefined</code>. This is easy to do in the C++ and java APIs, but not in the language itself.\n\n<p>It would be nice to have a way to determine the presence of an attribute in an ad. This could be done with a <span class=\"quote\">ClassAd</span> function, provisionally named exists(). It would take one argument. When given an attribute reference, it would check whether that reference refers to an existing attribute. It would return true if the attribute exists and false if it doesn't. It would return true if given an argument that's not an attribute reference.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:08:44 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-02 06:24", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Jun-02 16:35", "fixed_version": "2010-Jun-02 16:35", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
