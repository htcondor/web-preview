{"id": 5855, "title": "Ticket #5855: Move decision about shared port endpoint creation into daemon core.", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight now, daemon core daemons will create shared port endpoints if USE_SHARED_PORT is set, even if the master decided not to let them inherit a shared point endpoint.  Ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5769\" title=\"Fix HAD|REPLICATION configuration incompability.\">#5769</a></span> changed the shared point endpoint code to check &lt;SUBSYS&gt;_USE_SHARED_PORT before USE_SHARED_PORT, but this doesn't really address the problem, which is that the daemon itself should know if it needs special shared-port handling, and unless it's special, should respect what the master has decided its command sockets should be.  This logic will be complicated by our support for running the daemons without a master.  At any rate, while it might make sense to further modify the master to also support &lt;SUBSYS&gt;_USE_SHARED_PORT (or maybe &lt;DAEMON_NAME&gt;_USE_SHARED_PORT?), it seems like we'd be better off letting the HAD and REPLICATION daemons declare as a special exception to the general rule, that they will respect [HAD|REPLICATION]_USE_SHARED_PORT instead of USE_SHARED_PORT (because their configuration changes quite a bit when they use shared port).</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Aug-19 13:53", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Aug-19 13:53", "fixed_version": "2016-Aug-19 13:53", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5769", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
