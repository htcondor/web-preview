{"id": 7597, "title": "Ticket #7597: Fix docs for file transfer input/output remaps and directory support", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe current documentation is out of date, missing some existing features (<code>transfer_input_reamps</code>) and configuration knobs (<code>MAX_REMAP_RECURSIONS</code>), and contains outright lies about remaps not supporting directories.  This needs to be rewritten and include some examples with directories since they can be a little tricky.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Apr-27 14:29:22 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nSee also <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7327\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7327'); return false;\" title=\"transfer_output_remaps doesn't remap implicitly-listed files\">#7327</a></span>.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-03 14:45:07 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThe docs have been wrong for some time...
