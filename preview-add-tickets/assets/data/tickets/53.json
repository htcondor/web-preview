{"id": 53, "title": "Ticket #53: condor_master's invalidate attempt delays shutdown", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn a personal condor, e.g. all daemons on one machine, when shutting down the condor_master the COLLECTOR is quickly shutdown along with all other daemons. All the other daemons attempt to contact the collector and fail. Most do this quickly. The MASTER does the same thing, and its attempt appears to delay delivery of the termination signal to some daemons, in the example below it is the STARTD.\n\n<p><span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=MasterLog\" title=\"Master Log\">MasterLog</a></span>:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"restricted\"><pre>1/21 09:18:06 Got SIGQUIT.
