{"id": 7273, "title": "Ticket #7273: Remove unnecessary 3-second sleep when DAGMan starts", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight after starting DAGMan sleeps for 3 seconds, supposedly to ensure the process has a unique ID. The reasoning behind this was that if the system process IDs had rolled over, this new condor_dagman instance could collide with a lock file (using the same PID) that had been created previously.\n\n<p>However the only way this collision could actually happen is if a dagman crashes, then the underlying system rolls over 30,000 PIDs in less than a second and tries starting a new condor_dagman process that collides with both original PID and birthday. This is effectively impossible, so we're going to remove the 3-second sleep.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Oct-23 12:59</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=58244\">[58244]</a></span>: Added version history (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=7273\" title=\"Remove unnecessary 3-second sleep when DAGMan starts\">#7273</a></span>)  (By Mark Coatsworth )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Sep-19 15:24</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=57870\">[57870]</a></span>: Removed unneccessary sleep at DAGMan startup (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=7273\" title=\"Remove unnecessary 3-second sleep when DAGMan starts\">#7273</a></span>)  (By Mark Coatsworth )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Oct-23 13:08", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-Sep-19 15:24", "fixed_version": "2019-Sep-19 15:24", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "", "creator": "coatsworth", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu, gthain@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
