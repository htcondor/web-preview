{"id": 1311, "title": "Ticket #1311: Be able to configure DAGMan's actions when condor_rm'ed", "description": "<blockquote>\n(This is resulting from condor-users email today from Robert Mortensen.  The problem is that there's really no way to do what he wants.)\n\n<p>My idea is to have a config knob for DAGMan to tell it what you want it to do when it's condor_rm'ed.  Right now it just kills everything off, but you might want to do something like let jobs in the queue finish, or remove jobs but still run POST scripts, etc.  We need to think some about exactly what options we would want to allow, but this might be a really useful feature.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Mar-26 12:58:31 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nMaybe if you condor_rm it a second time, that should always do the \"hard\" remove.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-May-16 10:54:10 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- I'm going to downgrade the priority on this, because the halt file feature supplies at least some of the functionality discussed in this ticket.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-May-16 10:54", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Mar-26 11:33", "fixed_version": "2010-Mar-26 11:33", "broken_version": "v070501", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.eud, psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
