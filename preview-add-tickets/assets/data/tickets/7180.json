{"id": 7180, "title": "Ticket #7180: Refactor DAGMan so definition of a cluster is consistent", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen we added late materialization support to DAGMan, we struggled with how to name \"a cluster of jobs using late materialization\". Initially we called this a \"factory\", then later a \"cluster\". Then we decided that we should treat all clusters of multiple procs the same, regardless of whether they are being late materialized or not. So the naming in our code is wildly inconsistent.\n\n<p>We want to remove any notion of a \"factory\" from the DAGMan code, and refactor it such that a \"cluster\" consistently refers to a cluster of more than one proc, regardless of late materialization.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Aug-07 11:33:45 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is finished now. No documentation or version history needed since it's just a refactor/rename, no changes to code logic.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Aug-02 15:51</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=57563\">[57563]</a></span>: Refactored DAGMan event names: factory submit/remove events are now called cluster submit/remove (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7180\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7180'); return false;\" title=\"Refactor DAGMan so definition of a cluster is consistent\">#7180</a></span>)  (By Mark Coatsworth )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Aug-07 11:33", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-Aug-02 11:07", "fixed_version": "2019-Aug-02 11:07", "broken_version": "v080704", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "#6274", "creator": "coatsworth", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
