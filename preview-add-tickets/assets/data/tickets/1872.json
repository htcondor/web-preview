{"id": 1872, "title": "Ticket #1872: Grid jobs never rematch after failed $$() substitution", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen the gridmanager retrieves a job ad from the schedd, the schedd replaces occurrences of $$(Foo) with the value of Foo in the resource ad obtained via match-making. If the resource ad doesn't have a Foo attribute, the schedd immediately puts the job on hold. If the job is released, this same process repeats. There's no mechanism to rematch the job when this error occurs. The job is stuck in an unusable state.\n\n<p>When this error occurs, either the schedd or the gridmanager should modify the job ad so that it will be rematched. This can be done in addition to or instead of holding the job.\n\n</p><p>As a work-around, you can force the job to be rematched by munging some job attributes:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">condor_qedit &lt;job.id&gt; Matched False\ncondor_qedit &lt;job.id&gt; CurrentHosts 0\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:30", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Jan-25 10:41", "fixed_version": "2011-Jan-25 10:41", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "a21568", "customer_group": "fermi", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
