{"id": 756, "title": "Ticket #756: User specifiable behavior for backed up Condor cron jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\n(Based on a report by Scot Kronenfeld for the VDT.)\n\n<p>This is Greg Thain's idea, so he can expand on it.\n\n</p><p>He wanted to see more knobs regarding the behavior of jobs that stack up.  For example, if a job is supposed to run every 5 minutes (using cron* attributes to define this behavior), but the previous incarnation is still running when the next job would have been scheduled, what do you do?  You can give the user the choice of throwing the job away, queuing it up, etc.\n\n</p><p>Building on that last idea, what if multiple jobs are queued up?  Do you process them first first submitted to last, or last submitted to first.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 17:18", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Sep-22 11:49", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-22 11:49", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
