If these attributes trigger an on_exit_hold expression, for example, they are propagated to the job queue only in standard universe. Dan's change has them propagated in both cases, and has them reset by the SchedD if the job is subsequently released back to the IDLE state.\n\n</p><p>Chunks from the annotated diff of Dan's changes (which Todd has) that are associated with this ticket are labeled with a (19).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:21", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Feb-26 12:26", "fixed_version": "2009-Feb-26 12:26", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#2", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
