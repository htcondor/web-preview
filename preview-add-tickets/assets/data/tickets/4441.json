{"id": 4441, "title": "Ticket #4441: condor_install can be used for an initial configuration for testing", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe want any personal condor created for testing to use valid ports for the collector. \"condor_install\" which is really \"condor_configure\" in git would\nsetup condor_collector == condor_host with no dynamic port request. So I modified it to use MetaKNobs for the local config file and they get dropped first in the file. This is only for the option --make-personal-condor. For this option,\n\"use role : personal\" comes out first. We still allow condor_host to get the machine name(full) and we delete the daemon list which would have hidden the one\nset up by the role:personal.\n\n<p>So this means if you have a man folder in your release_dir you can go there\nand enter \"./condor_install --make-personal-condor\", set your path to those\nbins and CONDOR_CONFIG to release_dir/etc/condor_config, start condor_master\nand be ready to test.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Jul-03 12:49</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=40539\">[40539]</a></span>: We could not get a personal condor out of condor install that would use any port but 9618.
