{"id": 6525, "title": "Ticket #6525: Remove all rewriting of sinful strings in ads going on the wire", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn old versions of HTCondor, daemons would rewrite their sinful string in ads going on the wire to reflect the interface being used. As part of the IPv6 work in 8.3.x, this code was largely disabled (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5074\" title=\"Disable protocol-based rewriting, advertise IPv4 primary addresses.\">#5074</a></span>). But a variant of it was kept for HTConndor-CE (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=4849\" title=\"Rewrite all ads leaving collector on single-node pool\">#4849</a></span>). This variant, controlled by SHARED_PORT_ADDRESS_REWRITING, was \"born deprecated\". I believe this feature can now be removed entirely.\n\n<p>Removing the rewriting code should negatively affect only clients of HTCondor-CE that are older than 8.3.x and are IPv6-only. This seems like a very unlikely set of conditions today.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Jan-17 15:45</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=53154\">[53154]</a></span>: Docs for removal of ADDRESS_REWRITING configuration knobs. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6525\" title=\"Remove all rewriting of sinful strings in ads going on the wire\">#6525</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Jan-12 14:21</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=53135\">[53135]</a></span>: Remove unused variables related to sinful rewriting. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6525\" title=\"Remove all rewriting of sinful strings in ads going on the wire\">#6525</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Jan-11 14:46</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=53128\">[53128]</a></span>: Remove all rewriting of sinful strings in ads going on the wire. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6525\" title=\"Remove all rewriting of sinful strings in ads going on the wire\">#6525</a></span> Since 8.3, this code was only enabled via a \"born deprecated\" knob for HTCondor-CE to help clients older than 8.3.
