It seems that job-specific system\ninformation is not available right now?\n\n</p><p>Would it be possible to add them?\nWhat I would like to have is (by decreasing priority):\n1) job working directory\n2) PID of the job (or the head PID of a process tree)\n3) PID of the starter\n\n</p><p>And ideally I would like to be able to publish those in the slot <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span>.\n\n</p><p>Thanks,\n  Igor</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Aug-12 10:06:46 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nAnother condor-users post(s), from Matt Hope, requesting this:\n\n<p>I would love it if you would publish the location in the classad.\n\n</p><p>Heck even local to the current box would do, drive letter warts and all I can deal with this in code with consistent share structures.\n\n</p><p>Matt\n\n</p><p>-----Original Message-----\n\n</p><p>From: Matthew Farrellee\nSent: 10 August 2009 16:59\nTo: Condor-Users Mail List\n\n</p><p>Subject: Re: [Condor-users] Getting the output and error logs for an executing job\n\n</p><p>Horvatth Szabolcs wrote:\n  Hi Matt,\n  If you want to get data about a running job and don't want to have that data transferred to the schedd, you might try connecting to the machine where the job is running and looking at the data. condor_q -run x.y will show you where job x.y is running.\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  Yes, this is what I used to do with windows but its a bit fiddly finding\n  the proper condor work directory.

I don't think the local execute directory is published anywhere.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-17 16:13", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-17 16:13", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "a19220", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "sfiligoi@fnal.gov,dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
