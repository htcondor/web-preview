{"id": 5810, "title": "Ticket #5810: After shared_port restart, master should send update w/o addresses.", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, immediately after the master restarts the shared port daemon, it will send an update ad (indicating that the shared port daemon is down).  That update ad -- because the shared port daemon is down and the way the fix to the rewrite code works -- will contain an old* and not-rewritten address.  Instead, it should contain no addressing information at all, as it would if a condor_reconfig were issued while it was waiting for the shared port daemon's address file.  This more accurately and consistently reflect the actual situation.\n\n<p>* : Old is probably OK -- the shared port daemon's port will generally be fixed except in personal condors -- but not-rewritten could be bad (since address rewriting is necessary for backwards compatibility).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jul-27 15:36", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jul-27 15:36", "fixed_version": "2016-Jul-27 15:36", "broken_version": "v080409", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonMaster", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5801", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
