On other machines (e.g., clover-25.cs.wisc.edu) the chmod doesn't always fail.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Sep-23 16:54:05 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nLowering the priority and severity of this ticket, as the user didn't have the execute bit set on the executable....\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-05 18:55:15 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI have committed a fix for this problem.
