Today the Icon for status Claimed is used also when the machine is in Status Owner.\nWhen in Status Owner, condor_watcher says that the CPU is claimed but nojob claimed this CPU (the owner is claiming the CPU). As Condor has to do\nwith jobs running on the machine, in my oppinion introducing a new icon is\nappropriate.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-05 10:58:27 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070904 to v070905 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-22 11:40:52 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070905 to v070906 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Apr-22 11:40", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Dec-26 14:01", "fixed_version": "2012-Dec-26 14:01", "broken_version": "v070900", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "a24562", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
