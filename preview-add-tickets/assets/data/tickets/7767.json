{"id": 7767, "title": "Ticket #7767: condor_shadow activate/deactivates claim with wrong privilege", "description": "<blockquote>\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/pull/124\">PR#124</a>\n\n<p>Report from OSG is that, if all the schedd has token (say, in <code>/etc/condor/tokens.d/</code>) and the CCB is necessary to talk to the starter, then the <code>condor_shadow</code> will invoke the <code>activateClaim</code> RPC with <code>PRIV_USER</code>.\n\n</p><p>Unfortunately, since the token is owned by <code>PRIV_CONDOR</code>, doing a RPC which involves going to the CCB results in a permission denied.\n\n</p><p>We should ensure the shadow always does RPCs to the starter as <code>PRIV_CONDOR</code>.  So far, I've found <code>activateClaim</code> and <code>deactivateClaim</code>.  There might be others..</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Aug-05 02:54:19 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nAssigning to Zach, who volunteered to do the merge.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-07 12:19:49 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong>: What's there looks good, and I merged it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-07 12:23:04 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nAdditional thought:  Does this check for <code>isDaemon()</code> do the right thing inside DAGMan?  Internally, DAGMan is daemonCore and has type <code>SUBSYSTEM_CLASS_DAEMON</code>, but it acts as a client (on behalf of the user) when talking to the SchedD to do \"direct submit\" or to update job attributes.  So it should be using the user's tokens.  <code>set_priv(PRIV_CONDOR)</code> is essentially a noop inside dagman because there's no UID switching, so probably it's fine.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Sep-30 13:18:27 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThis was already reviewed and merged.  I'm going to add a note in version history and then resolve this ticket.
