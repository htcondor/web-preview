{"id": 884, "title": "Ticket #884: Event log fields not preserved with multiple writers", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe following are not preserved when multiple writers are writing to the event log\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>The event log's header \"creator name\".  I'm not certain if this should be preserved or not.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>I believe that the current behavior is correct.  Otherwise, there would be no way for an updated creator name to be propagated into the log headers.  If several writers are writing with different creator names, a race of sort occurs, but should cause no problems.\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>The base portion of the \"id\".  I'm pretty confident that this was working at some previous point in time.  This could potentially confuse the reader's \"find the next file\" logic.  I need to investigate this a bit further, and think about what the correct behavior is.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>This is definitely broken.  The \"base\" portion of the field is not being populated at all.  From reading the reader code, the fact that it's not propagated forward is correct behavior, or, at least, not incorrect behavior.\nThis will be fixed as soon as I test and push a fix.  This also adds the creator name, if supplied, to the file ID.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Oct-28 13:43</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=16187\">[16187]</a></span>: Event Log: Fixed a bug that was causing the base portion of the file ID in the header to be missing (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=884\" title=\"Event log fields not preserved with multiple writers\">#884</a></span>)  (By Nick <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LeRoy\" title=\"Le Roy\">LeRoy</a></span> )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:41", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Oct-23 13:57", "fixed_version": "2009-Oct-23 13:57", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "nleroy", "derived_from": "", "creator": "nleroy", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
