If nothing is specified, then the release tarball will be used.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Sep-14 15:01:58 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nAs discussed during the Flightworthy call, I think modifying the Bosco scripts should be relatively straightforward. The more interesting thing is defining what's the difference between devel, testing, prerelease, and release, especially since we're dealing with HTCondor and Blahp versions in these tarballs.\n\n<p>OSG is going to be more interested in the Blahp bits: I don't think we've ever had issues with the FT-Gahp or any other HTCondor bits in any of our Hosted CE deployments. So per-blahp commit tarballs + releases would be what we're most interested in.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Nov-09 12:04:17 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nI think this was done under HTCONDOR-21</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-11 09:08", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2020-Sep-02 11:41", "fixed_version": "2020-Sep-02 11:41", "broken_version": "", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tim", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "blin@cs.wisc.edu matyas@cs.wisc.edu bbockelman@morgridge.org", "due_date": ""}
