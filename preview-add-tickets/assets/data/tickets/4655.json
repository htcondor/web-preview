For example:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">COLLECTOR_HOST = $(IP_ADDRESS):0\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>On an IPv4 machine, COLLECTOR_HOST should look something like \"192.168.0.123:0\", but on an IPv6 machine it should be something like \"[fe80::250:56ff:fec0:1]:0\"  Currently, the latter is \"fe80::250:56ff:fec0:1:0\" which is definitely wrong.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-May-28 12:54", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Oct-13 16:59", "fixed_version": "2014-Oct-13 16:59", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#4492", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
