The issue there hits the hole in the proposed fix - the startd is not restarted. Jaime suggested a startd could wipe out VMs it does not know about on startup. That can address the NMI issue, but would suffer from the same problems as sharing slot users between startds, and assumes ONLY condor can start VMs on a machine (not necessarily valid even in NMI).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jul-09 15:18:54 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm implementing a fix where the starter can write an ad in the execute directory that contains information to cleanup a stranded job in the event of a crash. When the startd starts up, it will look for these cleanup files and take appropriate action. For now, this is only used for VM universe jobs.\n\n<p>This feature could be expanded to other job types, and even allow for recovery of running jobs after a crash.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Jul-14 13:33</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=15091\">[15091]</a></span>: Allow cleanup of stranded VM jobs after a crash.
