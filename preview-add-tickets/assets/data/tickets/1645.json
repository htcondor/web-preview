(I'm afraid I didn't re-run the <code>-better-analyze</code> invocation to see if the erroneous second REMOVE instruction was still present.)\n\n</p><p>So, from my experience, this <em>appears</em> to be purely a presentation issue -- the actual matching behavior of the various Condor services appears to be operating as designed; it's just the analysis code which isn't fully evaluating the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> expressions completely/correctly.  The notion that this issue is preventing jobs to match <em>seems</em> to be a red herring -- at least, it was in my case!\n\n</p><p>Our Condor pool contains only Linux hosts; Windows is not involved. <code>condor_version</code> on a typical machine currently reports:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">$CondorVersion: 7.4.2 Mar 30 2010 BuildID: 227044 $\n$CondorPlatform: X86_64-LINUX_DEBIAN50 $\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>(We're now mostly running on 64-bit Linux hosts, rather than the 32-bit that was prevalent at the time -- though we're still using the same binary release of Condor as before, so the above version string is otherwise accurate.)\n</p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-27 16:39:01 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070404 to v070405 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-04 14:54:48 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nAs this is very likely a condorq -analyze presentation issue, and the condor_q -analyze was heavily refactored in the recent past, I am abandoning this ticket.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jun-04 14:55", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2010-Sep-07 14:58", "fixed_version": "2010-Sep-07 14:58", "broken_version": "v070403", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
