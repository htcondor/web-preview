{"id": 1287, "title": "Ticket #1287: optimize handling of shadow failure (reduce fsyncs)", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen a shadow exits with an exception code, the schedd performs a number of updates to the job ad that are each committed as a separate durable transaction (one fsync per transaction).  The result is that a fairly low rate of shadow failures can cause the schedd to become unresponsive, which causes more shadow failures.  This can lead to an endless cycle of shadow failure.\n\n<p>Eight transactions happen in _mark_job_stopped().  Additionally, there is a transaction in jobExitCode() to increment the shadow exception count.  None of these transactions need to be durable.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Mar-17 11:19:25 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nNote that even job eviction causes mark_job_stopped() to be called, so one way to get into the cycle of failure was to start with a bunch of jobs being evicted.  Then the schedd became unresponsive and the shadow failure cycle ensued.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Mar-17 11:23</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=25376\">[25376]</a></span>: Documented optimization of handling of shadow exceptions in the schedd. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1287\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1287'); return false;\" title=\"optimize handling of shadow failure (reduce fsyncs)\">#1287</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Mar-17 10:58</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=17648\">[17648]</a></span>: Optimized handling of shadow exceptions. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1287\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1287'); return false;\" title=\"optimize handling of shadow failure (reduce fsyncs)\">#1287</a></span> The schedd was performing up to 9 individual durable transactions when updating the job ad in the aftermath of a shadow exiting with a failure code that leads to the job staying in the queue rather than completing.
