If we need to mention it for backwards-compability, at least mention it second and say that's why we're mentioning it.\n</li><li>Jaime and I aren't sure the whole \"not recommended\" thing is actually true (anymore) anyway.\n</li><li>And even if it were, it's not at all obvious why the <code>+</code> syntax actually helps the problem; wouldn't <code>+AccountingGrop = \"group_physics.todd.miller\"</code> break things just as badly as specifying it in two different attributes?  If the answer is some filter in <code>condor_submit</code>, and we recommend bypassing it, shouldn't we just remove the filter?</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Oct-14 15:44:16 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nI've removed most of the extremely incorrect documentation.
