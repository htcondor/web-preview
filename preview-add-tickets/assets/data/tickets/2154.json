{"id": 2154, "title": "Ticket #2154: SMTP_DOMAIN - Replace UID_DOMAIN as source of notification emails", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen sending notification emails we try sending it to Owner@$(UID_DOMAIN), or if UID_DOMAIN isn't set Owner@($FULL_HOSTNAME) (where Owner is the Owner of the job).  This works well for most cases, but sometime the UID_DOMAIN won't be the same as the domain where mail should be routed.  For example, I might have\n\n<p>UID_DOMAIN=cluster.example.com\n\n</p><p>to distinguish it from another computer pool that is just\n\n</p><p>UID_DOMAIN=example.com\n\n</p><p>but email should still go to example.com, not cluster.example.com. (condor-admin 22129 is such a case).  Of course, administrators would need to be careful to ensure that any username valid inside of cluster.example.com is still valid @example.com, but that is reasonable.\n\n</p><p>Current workaround: users must remember to set \"notify_user=adesmet@example.com\".\n\n</p><p>Proposal:  Add SMTP_DOMAIN or perhaps EMAIL_DOMAIN, as a known setting.  If present, Owner@$(EMAIL_DOMAIN) will be used in preference to UID_DOMAIN or FULL_HOSTNAME.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-May-17 12:46:44 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nOops.
