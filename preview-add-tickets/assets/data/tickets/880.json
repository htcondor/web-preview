{"id": 880, "title": "Ticket #880: Condor issues in ETICS production pool", "description": "<blockquote>\nETICS is running a Condor 6.9.5 prerelease on their pool, because as of last year it was the newest set of binaries we could provide to them that did not have a critical component broken.   The SL5 machines don't appear to work well with the RHEL 3 binaries running on them.  Jobs are not completing and are getting stuck in the middle of their build processes. This is in the ETICS production pool and is affecting production users.  There is no indication of error caused by Metronome in the Metronome logfiles.  An example of a recent problem from the StarterLog.vm1 on a SL5 platform:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>10/8 23:34:46 Process exited, pid=3808, signal=9\n10/8 23:34:46 condor_write(): Socket closed when trying to write 305 bytes to &lt;128.142.142.97:23356&gt;, fd is 5\n10/8 23:34:46 Buf::write(): condor_write() failed\n10/8 23:34:46 Failed to send job exit status to shadow\n10/8 23:34:46 JobExit() failed, waiting for job lease to expire or for a reconnect attempt\n10/8 23:35:07 Got SIGTERM.

This does not seem like the best solution, as it requires a lot of time and effort spent on older binaries and may not resolve the problem.\n\n</p><p>I have experimented with several newer versions of Condor in the ETICS test pool for the job migration work, which is when I uncovered the 7.1 &lt;-&gt; 7.2 incompatibility problem.  The <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=BatLab\" title=\"Bat Lab\">BatLab</a></span> pool is stuck running Condor 7.1.4.  In order to maintain versions at ETICS and UoW that are compatible for job migration work, I recommend we upgrade both pools to the same version of Condor. ETICS prefers the stable series for their production pool.  Which version to choose?\n\n</p><p>7.4.0\npros:\n\n</p><p>- new, latest, best release, will work with 7.4.0 built for old platforms, pool is happy, etc.\n\n</p><p>cons:\n\n</p><p>-not out yet\n\n</p><p>7.3.2\npros:\n\n</p><p>- stable series\n\n</p><p>cons:\n\n</p><p>- Do we know of the 7.4.0 binaries Nick built for our older platforms will work with a 7.3.2 submitter?\n- Any Condor upgrade for ETICS will require Condor config file changes and some of my time for assistance.  They are still using vms instead of slots, for example.\n- If any bugs found after 7.3.2 affect us or ETICS, namely any of the 7.4.0 blockers, we'll have to perform a second upgrade to 7.4.0 at UoW and ETICS when it's released.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Oct-23 12:17:41 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nAccording to the log above, the job exited w/ signal 9.\n\n<p>Typically this means one of two possibilities:\n</p><ol>\n<li>Especially if the job exited immediately upon startup, the job is a dynamically linked executable and one or more of the dynamic libraries is not present on the machine.
