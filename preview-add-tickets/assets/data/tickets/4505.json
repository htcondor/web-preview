{"id": 4505, "title": "Ticket #4505: service condor stop emits syntax error after condor_off", "description": "<blockquote>\nA relatively minor problem in the init.d script for Condor causes errors to be incorrectly printed to the screen (unsure if stdout/err) upon stopping the HTCondor service after a graceful shutdown of the startd. Steps to reproduce on Debian 7:\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>Run condor_off $nodename from central manager\n</li><li>Wait for startd to shutdown leaving procd and condor_master\n</li><li>On execute node, run \"service condor stop\". Get this output:\n</li></ol>\n\n<p></p><pre>  root@execute1000:~# service condor stop\n  Shutting down Condor (fast-shutdown mode)...  /etc/init.d/condor: 1: kill: Usage: kill [-s sigspec | -signum | -sigspec] [pid | job]... or\n  kill -l [exitstatus]\n  done.\n</pre>\n\n<p>Despite error, Condor has shutdown.\n\n</p><p>Normal behavior:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  root@execute1000:~# service condor start\n  Starting up Condor...    done.\n  root@execute1000:~# service condor stop\n  Shutting down Condor (fast-shutdown mode)...  done.</pre>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nI'm assuming based on the age of this ticket, and the fact that (I think?) it's just an annoyance and UI issue and not a functional problem, that it's safe to demote to priority 5.

The main impact of this (going by memory) is that configuration management systems want to know the state of services and do so through commands like \"systemctl status condor.service\".\n\n<p>If \"service X stop\" returns something other than code 0 then puppet borks and a chain of other configuration management problems can occur where a node stops properly updating its config. So it's important that systemctl/service commands be \"clean\" in their behavior.\n\n</p><p>Relatedly: Condor is a giant problem in state management because (effectively) condor_master knows more state than systemd.\n\n</p><p>I'd just close it but wanted to provide some context.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-Apr-10 15:41", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Aug-01 10:56", "fixed_version": "2014-Aug-01 10:56", "broken_version": "v080200", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "downes@uwm.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
