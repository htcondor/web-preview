The log is filled with lines like this:\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>11/06/14 15:35:11 (pid:5500) SharedPortCliient read would block; waiting for result for SHARED_PORT_PASS_FD to 5579_36b4 as requested by &lt;128.105.14.74:56662&gt;.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Usually, when the shared port daemon is handing off a connection to a daemon, it does so in non-blocking mode, which doesn't hit this behavior. But sometimes, blocking mode is used. Two specific examples are the shared port daemon connecting to the master to send a child alive, and one daemon connecting directly to another local daemon when it can't find the shared port daemon's contact information.\n\n</p><p>In SharedPortState::HandleResp(), if m_non_blocking is false, it should put the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ReliSock\" title=\"Reli Sock\">ReliSock</a></span> in blocking mode when reading from it.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jan-21 13:52:12 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis bug doesn't cause any failures.
