{"id": 4544, "title": "Ticket #4544: RequestMemory not enforced if not in Requirements?", "description": "<blockquote>\nMoate reported a problem yesterday (2014-08-20) where when he submitted jobs with a Requirements expression equivalent to Machine == \"target-machine\", and <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RequestMemory\" title=\"Request Memory\">RequestMemory</a></span> of 4GB, the job would run a 2GB slot.  It would appear that the startd is not properly enforcing <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RequestMemory\" title=\"Request Memory\">RequestMemory</a></span> (perhaps selecting the smaller of <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RequestMemory\" title=\"Request Memory\">RequestMemory</a></span> and the slot's available memory?).  This is using cgroups (the problem is detected by the job using &gt;2 GB of RAM) and partitionable slots, in the CHTC.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2014-Aug-20 14:20", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Aug-20 13:56", "fixed_version": "2014-Aug-20 13:56", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
