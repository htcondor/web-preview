Looks like the code was not merged.  Attached below find the original patch written in the days of v6.9 (as ticket216-v69.patch).  I merged it and brought it up to date w/ v7.0.5 - the patch applied to v7.0.5 also is attached below (as ticket216-v705.patch).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-24 18:25:06 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBTW, it looks like there are a lot of warnings comparing floating point with == or != (which is unsafe) in matchmaker.C.  Many of these warning pre-date this patch; some, however, were newly added with this patch.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-25 15:55:52 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSeems like these patches below have had a bug since the dawn of time: if\n<code>GRUOP_NAMES</code> is not specified at all in the config file, the negotiator\nwill ASSERT.  Fixing this before pushing the code into 7.2.x series.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Mar-09 15:44:19 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nAlrighty, code pushed into the V7_2-branch.  Will (a) resolve the RUST ticket, (b) merge the changes into the master branch, and (c) assign this ticket to GregT for a code review since I put code into the stable series.  Greg, please\ninspect the code commits references below, thanks.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Mar-09 17:21:32 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nLet's watch those merge conflicts, eh, big fella?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Mar-09 17:58:49 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\n;)  Will do.
