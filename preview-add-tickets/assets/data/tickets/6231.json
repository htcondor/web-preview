{"id": 6231, "title": "Ticket #6231: DAGMan parse failures not handled correctly on Windows", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen DAGMan encounters a parsing error (invalid tokens, reserved words, no node name, etc.) on Windows, condor_scheduniv_exec.1.0 fails to exit cleanly. This results in the job being rescheduled instead of failing outright. We can work around this by throwing a debug_error() message, which triggers DC_Exit(), but this is approach might have side effects. Need to figure out why these parse errors aren't being handled correctly on Windows and resolve it.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2017-Apr-21 11:32", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Apr-21 11:32", "fixed_version": "2017-Apr-21 11:32", "broken_version": "v080600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "", "creator": "coatsworth", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu, wenger@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
