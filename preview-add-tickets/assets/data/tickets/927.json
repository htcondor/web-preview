{"id": 927, "title": "Ticket #927: Have adaptive DAGMAN_USER_LOG_ SCAN_INTERVAL", "description": "<blockquote>\nI was just talking with Todd M, and he was saying that it would be really nice for NMI if DAGMan could adaptively change the DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL value.  Their DAGs start out with a bunch of small, fast jobs, and then submit big, long-lived jobs.  So if DAGMan started out with a small DAGMAN_USER_LOG_SCAN_INTERVAL value, and then increased it when events are infrequent, and decreased it when events are frequent, it would be nice for them.  Probably not a high priority, though.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Feb-12 11:34", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Nov-10 15:00", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-10 15:00", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
