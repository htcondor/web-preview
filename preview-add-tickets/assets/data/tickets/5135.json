The magic incantation in our top level .htaccess file appears to be:\n\n<p></p><pre>  RewriteEngine On\n  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\n  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/status\n  RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}\n</pre>\n\n<p>(This ticket is a successor to <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"tktview?tn=5028\" title=\"HTCondor Web site broken in HTTPS\">#5028</a></span>: HTCondor Web site broken in HTTPS)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2015-Jul-06 15:13", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jul-06 15:13", "fixed_version": "2015-Jul-06 15:13", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
