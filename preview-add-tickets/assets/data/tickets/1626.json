{"id": 1626, "title": "Ticket #1626: Make CCB default to on", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe only reason CCB isn't on by default is that it's not compatible with pre-7.6.0 stable releases.  For 7.7.x and 7.8.0, we should declare a lack of compatibility with 7.4.x for the benefit of removing yet another bit of configuration to worry about.  Just turn CCB on by default.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Aug-27 13:13", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Aug-27 13:13", "fixed_version": "2010-Aug-27 13:13", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
