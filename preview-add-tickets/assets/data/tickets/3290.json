{"id": 3290, "title": "Ticket #3290: condor_shadow doesn't play well with mulitple SPOOL dirs", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe condor_shadow is hard coded to look at SPOOL, and provides no means to pass it the same of a schedd it should be associated with.  The following config:\n\n<p></p><pre>  SPOOL = dir1\n  SCHEDD.SPOOL = dir2\n</pre>\n\n<p>would result in the shadow looking in dir1 instead of the appropriate directory dir2.  This is especially an issue if dir1 has never been setup with a schedd and is therefore missing the spool_version file.\n\n</p><p>The shadow needs a better means to track with its associated schedd.  A better solution might be to remove the reliance on the SPOOL directory all together.  Currently the reliance on the SPOOL directory seems to be tied to the File Transfer object.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-11 16:40:19 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070902 to v070903 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-22 10:54:51 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070903 to v070904 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-05 10:58:27 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070904 to v070905 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-22 11:10:10 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070905 to v070906 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Apr-22 11:11", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Oct-24 15:17", "fixed_version": "2012-Oct-24 15:17", "broken_version": "v070900", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "rrati", "derived_from": "", "creator": "rrati", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
