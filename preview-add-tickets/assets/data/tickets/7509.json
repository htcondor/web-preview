{"id": 7509, "title": "Ticket #7509: Add efficient querying of LSF job statuses to the blahp", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe blahp was previously enhanced to efficiently query the current status of PBS and SLURM jobs. When the status of one job is requested, the status script queries the status of all jobs and persistently stores the results. Subsequent requests for job status can used the stashed results if they're recent enough.\n\n<p>The Pegasus group has developed the same enhancement for LSF jobs, and would like to contribute it to the blahp codebase.\n\n</p><p>Details about the code can be found here in the Pegasus tracking system:\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://jira.isi.edu/browse/PM-1395\">https://jira.isi.edu/browse/PM-1395</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2021-Apr-28 13:30:06 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nAdded to BLAH repository.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"attach_get/1044/lsf_glite.patch\">lsf_glite.patch</a>\n30292 bytes added by georgpap on 2020-Feb-25 22:55:09 UTC.\n<br/>\nHello,\n\n<p>I have attached a patch file that applies the lsf_status.sh and lsf_status.py files to htcondor's master branch.\nI couldn't locate the original location of the files in the source code and I placed the files next the slurm_status.py script under /src/condor_gridmanager.\n\n</p><p>Please let me know if you want me to create a patch differently.\n\n</p><p>George<br/>\n</p></li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2021-Apr-28 13:30", "status": "resolved", "created": "2020-Feb-18 14:06", "fixed_version": "2020-Feb-18 14:06", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "jfrey@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
