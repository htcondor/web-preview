{"id": 5153, "title": "Ticket #5153: Add Travis CI yaml file", "description": "<blockquote>\nI'd like to add a <code>.travis.yml</code> file to the repository root.   This provides support for <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://travis-ci.org\">http://travis-ci.org</a>, a continuous integration product that's tightly integrated with Github.\n\n<p>Wait - you ask - don't we already have a CI product?  Travis CI itself is actually fairly limited - single platform, fairly limited amount of max build time, no separate testing phase from build.  It is no batlab!\n\n</p><p><strong>However</strong>, it has one killer feature missing from batlab: ability for unauthenticated users to trigger builds for arbitrary code.  The platform is container-based if sudo is unnecessary for building and VM-based otherwise.\n\n</p><p>Relative to the number of people with github accounts, batlab users are rare.  Allowing us to do clipped builds from arbitrary patches should help ease the pain of contribution (both for the contributors and the patch reviewers) from folks outside the core team.  We could check the results of the build from any newcomer before we start taking a close look.  This would be completely optional; I propose no changes to the contribution process.\n\n</p><p>I propose adding a minimal clipped build to enable support.  Other than adding a file to our repo, there's no other action needed.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jul-15 10:48:54 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nMarked this as experimental (and squashed all my experimental commits to a single commit so it's easier to revert if things don't pan out).\n\n<p>Please don't document or advertise this widely.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Jul-15 11:09</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=45310\">[45310]</a></span>: Allow uuid.h to be found outside /usr/include. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=5153\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5153'); return false;\" title=\"Add Travis CI yaml file\">#5153</a></span> Previously, uuid.h could only be found at /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h, making building against non-system uuid impossible / impractical.\u00a0[...]\n (By Brian Bockelman )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Jul-15 10:27</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=45309\">[45309]</a></span>: Add Travis-CI yaml file. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=5153\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5153'); return false;\" title=\"Add Travis CI yaml file\">#5153</a></span> See ticket for motivation.
