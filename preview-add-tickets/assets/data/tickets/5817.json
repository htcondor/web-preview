Docker containers for all jobs currently running at the time continued running, but HTCondor was not aware of this, therefore the jobs had effectively escaped from HTCondor's control.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-Jul-29 13:52", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jul-29 13:52", "fixed_version": "2016-Jul-29 13:52", "broken_version": "v080505", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "alahiff", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "andrew.lahiff@stfc.ac.uk, bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
