So the documentation is not really in the right place.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Feb-22 12:28:44 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nUpdated V7_5_6-branch section 4.2.1 on standalone checkpointing to contain reference links to 6.1.2 on platform specific info for Linux, also renaming the section.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2011-Feb-22 12:29", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Feb-22 10:35", "fixed_version": "2011-Feb-22 10:35", "broken_version": "v070506", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Std", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
