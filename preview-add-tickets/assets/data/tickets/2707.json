To accomplish this, he set initialdir to a directory in HDFS.  He then had to convert all of the input file references to absolute paths.\n\n<p>It would have been nice to have independent control over the default base path for input and output files.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Dec-12 17:26", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Dec-12 17:26", "fixed_version": "2011-Dec-12 17:26", "broken_version": "v070706", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "isfiligoi@ucsd.edu,dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
