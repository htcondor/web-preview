It seems like this might be generally useful, so I'm making this ticket.  (Maybe we should have options for a script to run in response to other events, as well.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Nov-01 10:44", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Nov-01 10:44", "fixed_version": "2010-Nov-01 10:44", "broken_version": "v070504", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, psilord@cs.wisc.edu, tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
