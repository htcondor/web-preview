{"id": 7420, "title": "Ticket #7420: Collector.directQuery cannot return multiple ads", "description": "<blockquote>\n<code>Collector.directQuery</code> always returns exactly the first ad it gets, which is not the correct semantics for its nominal command line equivalent <code>condor_status -direct &lt;address&gt;</code>, which can return multiple ads.\n\n<p>We probably can't directly fix <code>Collector.directQuery</code> for backwards compatibility right now, but we can add a new method that does the right thing.\n\n</p><p>Wild thought: maybe add a flag to the signature that switches between the old bad behavior and the correct behavior, old behavior by default? Might be a better deprecation/transition path. Could do this in Python if it's tricky in C++, leveraging a new \"private\" method <code>Collector._directQuery</code> that we don't document but does implement the right behavior.\n\n</p><p><code>Collector.directQuery</code> has other flaws as well.\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>There is no way to pass in a daemon address, this method <strong>always</strong> does a locate and then a direct query to the first locate result,\n  but a direct query should be able to work even if the daemon isn't advertising to a collector.\n</li><li>Both the Schedd and Startd can return ads of multiple types, some of which have no corresponding daemon_type\n</li><li>There is no constraint argument\n</li><li>The query command has a classad payload, and is thus extensible, but not all daemons accept the same options\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thus the proper solution is probably to deprecate this method, and add methods on the various daemon objects that do the equivalent of direct query\nbut without the locate.
