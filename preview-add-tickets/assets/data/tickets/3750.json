{"id": 3750, "title": "Ticket #3750: Improve DAGMan metrics reporting", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs per discussion with Miron, Ewa, and Karan today:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>All information needed for reporting should be specified in the DAG file itself, not by environment variables/configuration.  (Hmm -- I wonder if a per-DAG config file is okay?)\n</li><li>Instead of reporting \"simple\" and sub-DAG job totals, report by node category -- then the nodes can be split up however people want.  (Pegasus would specify appropriate categories in the DAG file.)\n</li><li>Have the Pegasus people provide the program/script that actually reports the metrics to their server.\n</li><li>Possibly pass info to the reporter program as a classad.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jul-15 16:28:07 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nWe should have totals for nodes that don't have a category, as well as for each category.\n\n<p>Also, I'm a little concerned about this interfering with the use of categories for throttling.  Maybe we should have separate categories for metrics reporting?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jul-31 17:52:35 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- something else just occurred to me:  in the current metrics reporting, we have the schedd machine's IP address as part of the dagman_id value.  I wonder if we can really consider this \"anonymous\" with that information included...</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3751\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3751'); return false;\" title=\"Implement DAGMan metrics tests\">#3751</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nImplement DAGMan metrics tests</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Jun-01 14:02", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jul-09 14:51", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-09 14:51", "broken_version": "v080100", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "#3532", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc,edu, vahi@isi.edu,wedell@bmrb.wisc.edu, coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
