{"id": 5923, "title": "Ticket #5923: JobStartDate is set inconsistently.", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe found that CMS has some code that <em>depends</em> on the fact that <code>JobStartDate</code> is always set when the job is in <code>JobStatus==2</code>.\n\n<p>This seems to usually be a safe assumption.  However, it seems there are some code paths (haven't figured them out) where <code>JobStatus</code> is set in one transaction, then <code>JobStartDate</code> is set in a following transaction.\n\n</p><p>That means there are some cases where the job is running but <code>JobStartDate</code> is unset.  In CMS, this triggers the issue described in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"tktview?tn=5921\" title=\"MATCH info dropped from user log on claim reuse\">#5921</a></span>.\n\n</p><p>We should figure out what the alternate code path is here and make sure that <code>JobStartDate</code> is set consistently.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-Sep-28 11:09", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Sep-26 15:40", "fixed_version": "2016-Sep-26 15:40", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "#4490", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bockelman@gmail.com", "due_date": ""}
