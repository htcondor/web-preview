{"id": 4309, "title": "Ticket #4309: Our data file transfer plugin is not very useful", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe have a file transfer plugin for the <code>data:</code> URL type. The form recognized by the plugin mostly follows the standard <code>data:</code> format, including the use of a comma to separate the description of the data from the data itself. This means that you can't use a <code>data:</code> URL in the input file transfer list, as Condor will interpret it as two different input filenames.\n\n<p>One possible solution is to depart further from the standard <code>data:</code> format. Already, we require the addition of two slashes after the initial <code>data:</code> and the addition of a slash and a filename at the end of the URL.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2014-Apr-14 16:04", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Apr-14 16:04", "fixed_version": "2014-Apr-14 16:04", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "FileTransfer", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
