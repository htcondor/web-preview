{"id": 804, "title": "Ticket #804: DAGMan should pass current JobPrio to children", "description": "<blockquote>\n<em>Note: This ticket abandoned, as similar work was done in</em> <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2167\" title=\"Propagate DAG node priorities down to job priorities\">#2167</a></span>\n\n<p>DAGMan should pass any <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobPrio\" title=\"Job Prio\">JobPrio</a></span> assigned to it onto the individual jobs it runs.\n\n</p><p>Use case: I'm a user with dozens of DAGs submitted.  I realize that they're all fighting for limited resources and that I'm likely to have them all finish at about the same time, instead of finishing one DAG before moving on to the next.  I have a few specific running DAGs that I would like to prioritize.\n\n</p><p>Current solution: Add a cron or Condor-Cron job that runs \"condor_q -constraint 'DAGManJobId==12345' | xargs condor_prio -p 10\" for each DAG I care about (replacing 12345 with the appropriate job ID).  The cron job should run frequently.\n\n</p><p>Desired solution: I simply say \"condor_prio -set 10 12345\".\n\n</p><p>Proposed implementation: just before submitting a job, possibly throttled to once or minute, condor_dagman will ask the condor_schedd what its current <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobPrio\" title=\"Job Prio\">JobPrio</a></span> is.  Newly submitted jobs will have the current <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobPrio\" title=\"Job Prio\">JobPrio</a></span> applied to them (\"condor_submit -append priority=10\").  On a regular basis, perhaps every five minutes, condor_dagman will check its own priority and will use condor_prio or similar to adjust its children if they have changed.\n\n</p><p>In a perfect world the schedd would be able to alert condor_dagman to priority changes, eliminating the need to poll.\n\n</p><p>Complications: What if a user really wants different priorities for different parts of the DAG, or even DAGman itself?  Is that a realistic concern?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Nov-17 11:26:40 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nIf we implement this option, I think there should be a config macro to turn it off, because for really large DAGs the performance hit could be significant, and some people won't want this feature.\n\n<p>Another option that Matt just suggested is to set job prio == dag submit time, so that DAGs submitted earlier will automatically have a better priority for their jobs.
