{"id": 3722, "title": "Ticket #3722: condor_status -direct different code path for submitter ads", "description": "<blockquote>\nSubmitter ads that are sent to the collector are created differently from submitter ads sent in response to a condor_status -direct.  That seems likely to diverge (if it hasn't already) and likely to create hard to diagnose bugs.  They should likely be unified.\n\n<p>Ads to send to the collector are created in Scheduler::count_jobs() (<a class=\"file\" href=\"rlog?f=src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp\">/src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp</a> around line 1303, look for \"SUBMITTER_ADTYPE\").  The bulk of the work is done by Scheduler::fill_submitter_ad (<a class=\"file\" href=\"rlog?f=src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp\">/src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp</a> around line 961).\n\n</p><p>Ads in response to condor_status -direct  are created in Scheduler::make_ad_list (<a class=\"file\" href=\"rlog?f=src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp\">/src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp</a> around line 1608) (called from Scheduler::command_query_ads <a class=\"file\" href=\"rlog?f=src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp\">/src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp</a> around line 1654).  The work is entirely done inside of make_ad_list.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2013-Jun-26 15:55", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jun-26 15:55", "fixed_version": "2013-Jun-26 15:55", "broken_version": "v080100", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
