{"id": 122, "title": "Ticket #122: Let admin and user set various rlimits for jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe admin (via the starter's configuration file) and the user (via the submit file or condor_qedit) should be able to set any of the available hard rlimits for a job about to start.  If both the user and the admin set them, the smaller value should be used.  This way the user or admin can reign in jobs that use excessive CPU, memory, disk in a single file, simultaneously open files, processes, or more.  An admin might want to set limits to, say, keep a job from thrashing.  A user might want to set limits because his programs occasionally go haywire, and he'd rather that haywire jobs be killed or limited than allowed to keep going.\n\n<p>The advantage of this over just policy is...\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>The hard limit is absolutely hard, while policy limits can be briefly overrun before the policy notices.\n\n<p></p></li><li>There are rlimits that limit things Condor does not currently track and would be extremely difficult for Condor to track.\n\n<p></p></li><li>It should be impossible for a process to sneak out from the limits, while it is possible for for a program to intentionally or accidentally evade Condor's policies.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>(Imported from <span class=\"drupalnode\"><a href=\"http://drupal-old.batlab.cs.wisc.edu/node/1708\">1708 (backup)</a> <a href=\"http://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/node/1708\">1708 (public)</a></span>)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Dec-12 17:05:37 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.4/3_13Setting_Up.html#SECTION0041313000000000000000\">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.4/3_13Setting_Up.html#SECTION0041313000000000000000</a></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2009-Dec-12 17:06", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jan-26 11:44", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-26 11:44", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "rrati", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
