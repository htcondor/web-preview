{"id": 2643, "title": "Ticket #2643: Win32 Condor tries to use user from the submit host on remote host", "description": "<blockquote>\nDiscovered this when trying to use condor-c between two Windows submit machines, but the problem problem crops up in other areas.  The basic problem is that condor tries to switch to a user@machine account on the remote submit machine using the originating submit machine's machine name.\n\n<p>In my test the originating submit machine is called CRANE and the user is johnkn. johnkn has local-machine accounts on both machines\n\n</p><p>The <span class=\"quote\">ScheddLog</span> on the remote submit machine shows the following error:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>11/17/11 10:05:49 (pid:3668) perm::init: Lookup Account Name johnkn failed (err=1332), trying Everyone\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This fails because the remote machine (VM-CRANE) is actually looking up account CRANE\\johnkn which does not exist on VM-CRANE.  What it should be doing to make Windows consitent with the way Linux works it be checking for\nthe a johnkn account without a domain name.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Nov-29 12:41</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=28481\">[28481]</a></span>: Edits to lots of 7.6.5 version history items. ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2658\" title=\"privsep + gid tracking + fork does not work\">#2658</a></span> ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2643\" title=\"Win32 Condor tries to use user from the submit host on remote host\">#2643</a></span> ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2644\" title=\"SetEffectiveOwner fails to detect current owner is effective owner\">#2644</a></span> ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2387\" title=\"transfer_input_files doesn't transfer directories on Windows.\">#2387</a></span> ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2614\" title=\"restart of glidein master causes leaked glexec processes\">#2614</a></span> ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2660\" title=\"% sign in hold message causes crash when writing xml user log\">#2660</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Nov-17 12:18</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=28304\">[28304]</a></span>: in Windows perm class, if we cant find user@domain account on the local machine, trying looking for an account without a domain and use that instead of immediately falling back to the Everyone account. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2643\" title=\"Win32 Condor tries to use user from the submit host on remote host\">#2643</a></span>  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Dec-17 12:57", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Nov-17 12:12", "fixed_version": "2011-Nov-17 12:12", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
