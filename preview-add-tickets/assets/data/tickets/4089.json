{"id": 4089, "title": "Ticket #4089: errno trashed by threading code for some IO operations", "description": "<blockquote>\nBlocking I/O operations in condor_read(), condor_write(), and Selector are surrounded by thread calls that allow other threads to run while the I/O blocks. After the operation completes, errno (or WSAGetLastError() on win32) is checked on failure. However, stop_thread_safe() makes calls that can overwrite that error code. The callers need to save errno/WSAGetLastError() before calling stop_thread_safe().</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Nov-22 13:16:20 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nAre you sure this code is needed?\n\n<p>My aging memory seems to recall that on with glibc, when using pthreads, <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-errnovariable/\">errno is stored in thread local storage automagically</a>.
