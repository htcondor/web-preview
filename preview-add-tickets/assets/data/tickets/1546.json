As such, a user requested the ability to see all dependent expressions at the time the expression was tested.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:19:13 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:19", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Jul-30 14:39", "fixed_version": "2010-Jul-30 14:39", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
