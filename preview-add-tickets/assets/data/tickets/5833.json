Is it possible now?\n\n</p><p>Cheers,\nJose</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2016-Aug-06 12:00", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Aug-06 12:00", "fixed_version": "2016-Aug-06 12:00", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jcaballero", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
