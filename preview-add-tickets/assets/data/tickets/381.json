{"id": 381, "title": "Ticket #381: Set job's temporary directory to the job's scratch directory", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, we have it configured that all non-logging daemons log to <code>NUL</code>; unfortunately, since we lock on a file name, <code>NULL</code> can sometimes be locked by multiple processes and not be assessable to others.  As such it seems reasonable to direct the logs to the job's scratch directory, so that they can be cleaned up, once the job is complete--an attempt to reproduce the semantics on unix, except we will use real log file names instead of <code>/dev/null</code>.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Oct-18 15:13:30 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nAs we are changing the logging to be O_APPEND, this won't be a problem anymore.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Oct-18 15:13", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Apr-15 09:34", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-15 09:34", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "burnett", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
