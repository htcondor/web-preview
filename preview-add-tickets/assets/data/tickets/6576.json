At the time, during match evaluation, references to attributes in the peer ad had to have a TARGET scope prefix in new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> (but didn't in old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>). This code was an attempt to hide this change in evaluation semantics from users. It was prone to a lot of problems, so we ultimately added a hack in the new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> library to allow the evaluation semantics of old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>. We haven't tried to make users change their expressions to follow the new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> semantics, so this code is just dead weight.\n\n<p>In the one place where this code is in actual use (the EvalBool() that takes an unparsed expression string), none of the callers need the removal of TARGET scope prefixes.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Mar-06 14:27:45 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nNo user-visible changes, so no version history.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Feb-23 11:41</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=54352\">[54352]</a></span>: Remove code that adds/removes TARGET. scoping in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> expressions <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6576\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6576'); return false;\" title=\"Remove code that adds/removes TARGET. scoping in ClassAd expressions\">#6576</a></span> This code was added to ease the transition from old to new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>.
