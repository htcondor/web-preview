One of the two should.\n</li><li>Bug: When the directory doesn't exist, it defaults to /tmp/condorLocks. Not finding the lock directory should probably be a fatal error.  Using an unexpected location can cause strange results; in Dan's case /tmp ran out of inodes.\n</li><li>Bug: If the directory is missing, condor_preen cleans tries to clean the missing directory, not where the files actually went.  Fixing bug 2 should fix this, but ideally condor_preen should identify the lock directory identically to how the other programs do.</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2014-Mar-21 16:35", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Mar-21 16:35", "fixed_version": "2014-Mar-21 16:35", "broken_version": "v080005", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "a26747", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
