{"id": 4125, "title": "Ticket #4125: Separate log file for POST script terminated events?", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt might make sense to have DAGMan write and read the POST script terminated events to/from a separate log file (separate from either the overall workflow log or the individual log files specified in node job submit files).  That would avoid having DAGMan writing to a log file that other Condor processes are also writing to (probably especially helpful if we do <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"tktview?tn=963\" title=\"Have a Condor event logging daemon that does all log file writing\">#963</a></span>: Have a Condor event logging daemon that does all log file writing).\n\n<p>Also see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3994\" title=\"Require DAGMan to run in workflow log mode?\">#3994</a></span>: Require DAGMan to run in workflow log mode?, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"tktview?tn=4059\" title=\"DAG-level NOOP jobs shouldn't need submit file if using workflow log\">#4059</a></span>: DAG-level NOOP jobs shouldn't need submit file if using workflow log.\n\n</p><p>Sadly, I guess if we do this we'd need another knob to allow the user to specify the path for this log file...
