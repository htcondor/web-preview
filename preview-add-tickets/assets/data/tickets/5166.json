In this situation, would it be better to have an option for scheduler universe jobs to inherit the schedd's environment, like we allow with the starter?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Aug-07 11:34:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nOn second thought, this can also be a problem when each schedd has its own configuration file. But propagating CONDOR_CONFIG from the schedd's environment sounds like a better solution, as there could be parameters beyond SCHEDD_DAEMON_AD_FILE and SCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE that DAGMan should know about from the schedd's configuration.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Oct-20 16:44</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=46046\">[46046]</a></span>: Version history for scheduler universe env.var. changes. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5166\" title='Scheduler universe jobs should default to \"correct\" schedd'>#5166</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Jul-22 22:30</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=45389\">[45389]</a></span>: Set environment variables so scheduler job will find schedd. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5166\" title='Scheduler universe jobs should default to \"correct\" schedd'>#5166</a></span> This commit sets _condor_SCHEDD_DAEMON_AD_FILE _condor_SCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE environment variables for all scheduler universe jobs; this allows the job to find the schedd they were launched under.\u00a0[...]\n (By Brian Bockelman )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Oct-20 16:44", "status": "resolved", "created": "2015-Jul-20 22:11", "fixed_version": "2015-Jul-20 22:11", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#5162", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
