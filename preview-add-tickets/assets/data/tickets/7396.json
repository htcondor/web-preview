We should do a 8.8.x bugfix to accept either log line format (that is, I like the improved message but we should just restore compatibility).\n\n</p><p>This forward compatibility is important in cases where the user might have their own conda-installed python bindings in an older series but the system schedd is newer.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-Nov-22 09:34", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Nov-22 09:34", "fixed_version": "2019-Nov-22 09:34", "broken_version": "v080804", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelman@morgridge.org tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
