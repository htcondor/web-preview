{"id": 192, "title": "Ticket #192: Porting table put into wiki", "description": "<blockquote>\nA tool should be written which given a build id will scrape the distros out of NMI for built and tested versions of Condor including the cross tests. This information may possibly be able to be alternatively retrieved via analysis of submit_info. Then the tool emits the wiki-markup for the porting table that includes the known native ports in addition to the cross tests. During release of Condor, a human being runs this tool on the all green buildid of the version of Condor we shall release, and copies the text into the porting table page in the wiki.\n\n<p>This should get rid of the stupid porting page which is incomprehensible anyway.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Aug-05 13:16:49 by bgietzel:</em> <br/>\n\nAny progress here?
