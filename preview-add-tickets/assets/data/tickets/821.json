The settings for ALLOW_READ/DENY_READ and ALLOW_WRITE/DENY_WRITE should also be included, because this is how Condor works internally: HOSTALLOW_* and ALLOW_* lists are added together, as are HOSTDENY_* and DENY_*.\n\n<p>Another question is what the hadoop code will make of the full Condor authorization syntax, which may include the authenticated user name in addition to a hostname (username@domain/hostname).  Even HOSTALLOW/HOSTDENY settings can contain such entries.  Will the hadoop code simply ignore them, or will it get confused by them?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nFixed for 7.4.0.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Oct-16 15:34</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=16108\">[16108]</a></span>: Have the Windows installer use the ALLOW/DENY configuration parameters instead of the old HOSTALLOW/HOSTDENY options.
