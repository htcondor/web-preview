{"id": 3648, "title": "Ticket #3648: look into different upgrade scenarios for condor rpm", "description": "<blockquote>\nDepending on the scenario, an administrator may want the condor service to stop immediately (ie, not hang), or to wait for jobs to finish, etc.\n\n<p>When is it appropriate to do condor_off -fast vs -graceful vs -peaceful?  Can we make the upgrade process deal with more than one type of scenario?  (maybe depending on config file settings?)\n\n</p><p>How is a (potentially large) active pool upgraded?  What does the upgrade look like from each of the node types?  (Fermi has reported upgrades being a pain on the execute nodes.)  Do things work when a large active pool is in progress upgrading?  Etc.\n\n</p><p>Look into potential issues related to different upgrade scenarios and see if there is a way to handle them reasonably.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, the mechanism for HTCondor to automatically detect upgrades is used, which seems to cover the most general cases and at a minimum covers what the other RPMs are doing.  This may be good enough.  For now we just want to make sure nothing breaks when upgrading from the previous rpms.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2013-Aug-22 11:29", "status": "active", "created": "2013-May-21 14:06", "fixed_version": "2013-May-21 14:06", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "edquist", "derived_from": "#3638", "creator": "edquist", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "edquist@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
