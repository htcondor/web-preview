This inconsistency can keep admins from discovering the error\nin their config files in the first place.\n\nThe master prints the error message to stderr instead of logging it, and\nexits without shutting down any of its children.  These should probably\nboth be fixed.\n\nThe logging is most important to me, though I think that from an admin's\npoint of view, the ideal behavior is that if a reconfig fails due to\nbroken files (or any other reason), that Condor should keep running with\nthe old config.  I have no idea how feasible that is with the Condor\ncodebase.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>Given this is an issue for both OSG and LIGO, I'd like to target it for early in the v8.4 series.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Sep-23 16:17:42 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nSo prioritize it as a 2?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Sep-23 16:48:18 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Tom, you can keep the priority at whatever makes sense for LIGO.

(That is unless there are people changing config files and then rebooting the machines, etc).\n\n<p>So The quick-and-dirty solution is to have condor_reconfig check to see that all of the config files that IT reads are group &amp; world readable before sending the reconfig message.\n\n</p><p>The better solution would be to change the behavior of the master on reconfig so that it first parses the new config files, and only if they are valid does it actually reconfigure and send the reconfig message on to its children\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Sep-23 17:29:03 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nI propose that if condor_reconfig is running as root, it should change it's uid to condor and then do an access check on each of the config files.  if any fail the access check it will print out an error message and then exit without sending the reconfig.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Oct-06 16:06:48 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nI have a patch that changes condor_reconfig/on/off/restart to check to see if the config files are readable by the condor user if the tool is run as root.
