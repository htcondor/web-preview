{"id": 6492, "title": "Ticket #6492: DAGMan inconsistently tracks job holds, aborts jobs too early", "description": "<blockquote>\nSome CHTC users were getting their DAGMan jobs aborted for exceeding DAGMAN_MAX_JOB_HOLDS, although these jobs clearly had far fewer held procs than the maximum limit. This turned out to be more than a simple bug; DAGMan is fundamentally confused about how it tracks job holds.\n\n<p>The problem is fairly basic. Some parts of the DAGMan code track held procs on a per-job basis, whereas other parts of the code track holds across the entire DAG. From reading the code, it seems like DAGMan was originally tracking on a per-DAG basis, then someone started refactoring it to a per-job basis, but they stopped halfway through.\n\n</p><p>We need to pick one or the other. Given that we seemed to be moving to per-job tracking, this seems like the obvious solution to me. Any objections?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Nov-30 17:15:31 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nI've moved this from stable release to dev since it turned out to be more complex than a regular bug. Previously, we aborted a DAG node if it exceeded DAGMAN_MAX_JOB_HOLDS holds across its entire lifetime. I've changed this so now the holds need to be simultaneous.\n\n<p>However, the previous behavior is still desirable in certain cases. We should plan to implement both of them, but we have to balance this out across per-node or per-DAG tracking.
