{"id": 3719, "title": "Ticket #3719: condor_q/condor_status command line debugging", "description": "<blockquote>\n<strong>In Progress</strong>\n\n<p>This is collecting a variety of reports of problems with condor_q and condor_status, with a focus on how they interpret command line arguments and how that might differ from how a human interprets them.  The action for them is to investigate; depending on what is found individual tickets may be opened for bug fixes or feature changes.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>condor_status -submitters reports double actual running job count</h2>\n\n<p><strong>RESOLVED</strong>: See <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3713\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3713'); return false;\" title=\"condor_status -submitters doubles running job count\">#3713</a></span>: condor_status -submitters doubles running job count\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>condor_status -t only works as last option</h2>\n\n<p><strong>RESOLVED</strong>: See <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4096\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4096'); return false;\" title=\"condor_status -t only works as last option\">#4096</a></span>: condor_status -t only works as last option\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>condor_q -global doesn't report summaries</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Reproduced by adesmet in 8.0.0</strong>\n\n</p><p>\"condor_q\" prints a summary line at the end that looks something like:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">451 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 302 idle, 149 running, 0 held, 0 suspended\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>\"condor_q -global\" doesn't pretty a summary of any sort, either overall, or on a per schedd basis.\n\n</p><p>This may not be a bug (check for regression), just a behavior change request.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>condor_status -long -const JobId==...</h2>\n\n<p><strong>CLOSED:</strong> We can't reproduce.
