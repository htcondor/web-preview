(I don't think we necessarily have to test <strong>every</strong> event we're trying to filter out, but at least one...)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2012-Nov-16 16:31", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Nov-16 16:31", "fixed_version": "2012-Nov-16 16:31", "broken_version": "v070901", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#3311", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
