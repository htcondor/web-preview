Everywhere that we have hooks, we should pull the code that manages the hook into a plugin.  As a result we would have plugins everywhere, with some defaulting to using a plugin that happens to provide the old hook interface.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 17:20", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Sep-29 16:21", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-29 16:21", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
