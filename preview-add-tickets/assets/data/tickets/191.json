{"id": 191, "title": "Ticket #191: Push more testing functionality into CondorTest.pm", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere are layering problems with many things currently being done in batch_test.pl because really ought to be done in the core test module\nCondorTest.pm.\n\n<p>Move functions like core and ERROR testing to the lowest levels.\nMove Exemption handling also with requests for exemptions coming\nexplicitly from the test.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nAll current code has been moved out of batch_test.pl into CondorTest.pm and needs to be hooked up. Three scenarios are of concern. A test is wrapped either as a decision of the test or because we are wrapping them all or a test is running with others in a personal condor. The first case is trivial and should be up soon.\nThe second case breaks down into when we are running sequentially or concurrently.\nSequential checks will be time slices of the logs and core files produced strictly within the test. Concurrent testing not involving wrapped tests is an undecided about what action to take when N different tests may have contributed or one that testing of N all saw. Mechanism for detecting sequential vs concurrent will be access to a locked shared file. More then one test in it the we are concurrent testing.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:16", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Feb-05 15:57", "fixed_version": "2009-Feb-05 15:57", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "bt", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
