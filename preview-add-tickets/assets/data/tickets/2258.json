Does doing what is suggested above actually result in any significant time or memory savings on a negotiation cycle? No before/after performance results are reported.  At first blush from the description, seems like it may just be adding complication/code for an insignificant speedup.  Would love to be proved wrong, but until such time I am going to mark this ticket as abandoned.\n\n<p>The attached patch is not a patch file btw, it is html.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"attach_get/382/machlist.patch\">machlist.patch</a>\n61640 bytes added by jrt on 2011-Jun-21 17:04:33 UTC.\n<br/>\nbeta version of patch. \n\n<p>The patch adds a size_array to manage size information in the\nautocluster class.
