However, we\nwant to give user B the possibility to move into certain slots and hence set\nthe machine RANK to something like this:\n\nRank = IfThenElse(WantGPU =?= true,1000,0)\n\n(also with prefix TARGET.)\n\nUser A does not have this set, should thus have a lower Rank than User B (me),\nhowever, it seems this does not help:\n\n06/28/11 14:25:55 Socket to carsten@test.atlas.local (&lt;10.20.40.16:35426&gt;)\nalready in cache, reusing\n06/28/11 14:25:55     Over submitter resource limit (0.000000, used 0.000000)\n... only consider startd ranks\n06/28/11 14:25:55     Sending SEND_JOB_INFO/eom\n06/28/11 14:25:55     Getting reply from schedd ...\n06/28/11 14:25:55     Got JOB_INFO command; getting classad/eom\n06/28/11 14:25:55     Request 00102.00000:\n06/28/11 14:25:55 matchmakingAlgorithm: limit 0.000000 used 0.000000 pieLeft\n0.000000\n\n06/28/11 14:25:55       Rejected 102.0 carsten@test.atlas.local\n&lt;10.20.40.16:35426&gt;: fair share exceeded\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jun-28 14:58:31 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nPatch below already pushed to V7_6-branch, assigning to Dan for a code review.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Jun-28 17:14</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=22331\">[22331]</a></span>: Added a test to confirm that startd rank trumps user priority. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"tktview?tn=2275\" title=\"Startd RANK will only preempt if user priorities allow it\">#2275</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Jun-28 16:22</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=22328\">[22328]</a></span>: Another fix for startd rank trumping user priority. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"tktview?tn=2275\" title=\"Startd RANK will only preempt if user priorities allow it\">#2275</a></span> It should trump even when we are not only considering startd rank.
