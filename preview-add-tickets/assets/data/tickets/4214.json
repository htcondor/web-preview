The \"-append\" option to add things like\n\"request_disk\" and \"request_cpu\" to condor_run submissions would be\nhelpful.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Feb-18 09:11", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Feb-18 09:11", "fixed_version": "2014-Feb-18 09:11", "broken_version": "v080004", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "s8399", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
