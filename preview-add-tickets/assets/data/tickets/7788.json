That is, the hostname isn't preserved along the way.  Yeah, might be screwy.  But also there are a couple issues to watch out for.\n\n<p>For INCOMING connections (which I know this is not, but bear with me), consider this:\n\n</p><p>I can configure siue.zmiller.com to return IP address 146.163.10.129.  So you can't trust the resulting IP address given only a hostname.\n\n</p><p>If I control the reverse record for IP 66.33.223.207, I could make it say that it is \"htcondor-ce.isg.siue.edu\".  So you can't trust the resulting hostname given only an IP address.\n\n</p><p>For security the correct thing to do is to reverse map the IP that connected to you and then forward resolve it again.\n\t<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/350.html\">https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/350.html</a>\n\n</p><p>Now, this is the client barfing for an OUTGOING connection, so the reason is probably stupid and is probably the first sentence in this email.\n\n</p><p>If you disable the hostname check, I would guess it skips the reverse lookup, so that might work for you in the short term.  Or maybe the current code does the reverse lookup anyway and then just skips the check, which would be dumb but not at all out of the question.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-10 13:39:15 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nAh, I did create a ticket for this issue: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=7764,4\">https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=7764,4</a>. I'll close that as a dupe.\n\n<p>Do we lose any other checks by disabling the hostname check? I'd like to know before I tell GlideinWMS factory ops to add this to their configuration.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-10 15:04:22 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\n&gt; Do we lose any other checks by disabling the hostname check? I'd like to know before I tell GlideinWMS factory ops to add this to their configuration.\n\n<p>Yes: the client will accept any valid certificate instead of making sure the DN / SAN matches expectations.  I.e., you basically disable security.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-10 15:16:44 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nAh yeah, then the workaround is a no-go for us.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-10 15:38:13 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nSetting <code>\"GSI_SKIP_HOST_CHECK=true\"</code> doesn't completely \"disable security\".  It means the certificate used doesn't need to contain the hostname that matches the DNS hostname that the connection is coming from.  You still need a valid cert, signed by a trusted CA, with a subject name that is present in the mapfile, and that maps to a principal that is in the ALLOW_* list.  If that's not restrictive enough though then as you said that workaround won't work.\n\n<p>The other thing mentioned in the error message is setting GSI_DAEMON_NAME to the full DN.  That check might happen before any of the mapping (that code pre-dates the mapfiles) and so might let you succeed without the reverse DNS records.  Did you try it?  (If trying it out is disruptive, I can look at the code, which I haven't done recently...)\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-10 15:45:07 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nWould we have to set <code>GSI_DAEMON_NAME</code> on the client side or could we do it server side, i.e. on the CE?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-10 15:58:07 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\n&gt; Setting \"GSI_SKIP_HOST_CHECK=true\" doesn't completely \"disable security\"\n\n<p>Ah - that depends on whether you're speaking about the general case or specifically about the OSG HTCondor-CE.\n\n</p><p>OSG accepts Let's Encrypt server certificates so it's fairly trivial to acquire a valid host cert.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-11 11:24:45 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nBut they don't just accept any Let's Encrypt cert, right?  I assume something does some kind of authorization based on the subject name.  (Which is the host name).\n\n<p>Sure, if I, as an attacker, could steal a host cert issued by Let's Encrypt that you've already authorized, then I can impersonate that host.  Is that the threat you are guarding against?  Or what am I still missing?  Because although a bit tedious to enter in the config file, there might still be a workaround:\n\n</p><p>(I haven't tried this experiment so before anyone does a lot of config work let's just discuss it.)\n\n</p><p>You could have a Let's Encrypt certificate for moria.cs.wisc.edu.  DN is \"/CN=moria.cs.wisc.edu\".  In the certificate mapfile you have an entry:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">GSI \"/CN=moria.cs.wisc.edu\" x509_host_moria\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>And in the config file you have:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">ALLOW_DAEMON = x509_host_moria/128.105.121.1\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This should work even with <code>GSI_SKIP_HOST_CHECK=true</code> and still encforces that the connection originated from moria.  Just instead of doing it in the authentication layer, we're doing it in the authorization layer.\n\n</p><p>Whether or not the circumvents the code that does the reverse-DNS I will leave as an exercise to the administrator... :)\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-12 22:26:52 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\n&gt; But they don't just accept any Let's Encrypt cert, right? I assume something does some kind of authorization based on the subject name. (Which is the host name).\n\n<p>No, the clients currently depend on forward-resolution for that... there's no authoritative list that we can depend on.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-19 15:08:52 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nTodd and I just had a realization:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>I had assumed there was something broken in the client itself where the alias is dropping from the sinful string.\n</li><li>However, Todd pointed out that there may be a misconfiguration in the schedd and the alias isn't going into the sinful string itself in the collector ad.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>@ZKM or blin: Can you please provide a full sinful (contents of the <code>MyAddress</code> attribute) from your example case?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-19 15:19:16 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nThe problem was going to CE at siue.edu, and <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=MyAddress\" title=\"My Address\">MyAddress</a></span> to that daemon does NOT include an <em>alias</em> field - behold:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">\u03bb condor_status -pool collector.opensciencegrid.org:9619 -schedd -af name myaddress | grep siue\nhtcondor-ce.isg.siue.edu &lt;146.163.10.129:9619?addrs=146.163.10.129-9619&amp;noUDP&amp;sock=660459_b768_40&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Note that of all the reporting OSG CEs, 32 do have an <em>alias</em> field, and 112 do not.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-19 16:14:57 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nInteresting!
