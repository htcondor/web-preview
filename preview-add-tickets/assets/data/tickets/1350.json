(If you're lucky.  If you're unlucky, if sheer chance deals you a valid timer, but not necessarily the one you wanted.)\n\n<p>It looks like <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=15839\">[15839]</a></span> (ef3c7ff02ea0dff9dd7c42d1cf32350461a9ec06) broke things.\n\n</p><p>This is almost certainly the cause of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1337\" title=\"condor_kbdd 100% cpu usage\">#1337</a></span></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Apr-16 13:48:54 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nResolved as part of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1337\" title=\"condor_kbdd 100% cpu usage\">#1337</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Apr-27 15:28", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Apr-14 16:06", "fixed_version": "2010-Apr-14 16:06", "broken_version": "v070402", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "#1337", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
