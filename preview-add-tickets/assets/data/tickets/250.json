{"id": 250, "title": "Ticket #250: Add md5sum/sha1sum checksums to our download tarballs", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn order to add md5sum/sha1sum checksums to our download tarballs, we will need to first add detection for the md5sum and sha1sum programs, and the md5 perl module, into configure.\n\n<p>I've already done the md5sum and sha1sum programs, and need to do the perl module work.\n\n</p><p>The intention of this feature is to create checksums directly on the build machines for the publicly releasable tarballs and rpms for Condor, and to validate the externals that we pull from the web.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jun-08 15:38:33 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nStarting to fix configure....\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-18 11:50:31 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nFor Win32, I guess we should add m5sum.exe into msconfig, and have it invoked by dopackaging.bat.  Also someday it'd be cool to have the MSI files digitally signed, aka MS Authenticode.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-30 15:12:37 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThe unix side of this stuff seems to be code complete. Testing.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-30 16:51:41 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nOn Windows side, first need to get makemsi to run on Condor, then modify the current script used to package Condor in order to have NMI be able to build the package, and then we can do the md5 checksum.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jul-01 14:22:55 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI've completed the unix side and pushed it into the repository. I left the default state of the hard requirement of the checksums off and currently it is\na soft requirement. After I'm satisfied with how it works in NMI and how it'll end up on the web page, I'll make it a hard requirement.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jul-01 14:51:14 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nTicket is stalled because:\n<ul>\n<li>Must wait for NMI to show good checksum production for a few days.\n</li><li>Must wait because Z has to wait for makemsi to be functional for windows.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Once NMI shows the checksums being made for all of our platforms, I will make the checksum production a hard requirement.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jul-02 11:52:20 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nAfter watching it go for a night. I added some prereqs to submit_info to allow finding of the coreutils package.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jul-08 11:58:22 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nMakemsi is now functional on Windows Condor jobs.  Need Ben to get back so I can talk to him about the actual packaging and I need some help with getting Condor to build on the x64 OS, since we did not support this in the past.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jul-09 11:57:05 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nIt seems that x86_macos_10.4 still needs some loving to get the checksums. This is the only unix platform left that needs work.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jul-10 15:49:53 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nIt worked, so the unix side is ready.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Dec-01 09:56:06 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThe last status of this ticket is that the windows side must be completed for the generation of an md5 sum. This is dependent upon the windows MSI installer being automated. This ticket is still stalled.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-05 13:08:50 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm in the process of automating the MSI creation into NMI....\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Apr-27 16:01:39 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThe MSI automation hit a brick wall. So unix still makes the md5 and sha1 files, but windows is still not automatically making them.\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Jul-02 11:42</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=15002\">[15002]</a></span>: Added coreutils-5.2.1 to a few platforms as a prerequisite for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"stalled\" href=\"tktview?tn=250\" title=\"Add md5sum/sha1sum checksums to our download tarballs\">#250</a></span>.
