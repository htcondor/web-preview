This should make it easy for new users to get started with a quick install.\n\n</p><p>Later sections of the manual page will get more detailed and serve as a reference.\n\n</p><p>Please have a look and let me know.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2017-Dec-04 15:47", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2017-Jul-07 16:27", "fixed_version": "2017-Jul-07 16:27", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "coatsworth", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu, gthain@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": "20170801"}
