{"id": 626, "title": "Ticket #626: Improve interaction between VM and host startds", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe parameters VMP_VM_LIST and VMP_HOST_MACHINE allow a startd in a VM to interact with a startd running on the host OS. The current code assumes the two startds are vying for the same cpu(s). Thus, it tries to ensure that only one of the two startds can run a job at a given time.\n\n<p>The VM startd periodically polls the host startd. If the host startd is not in Unclaimed or Owner state, the VM startd sets its START expression to False. If the host startd is in Unclaimed or Owner state, the VM startd using the normal START expression and the host startd sets its START expression to False. Once a VM startd decides it can match jobs, the host startd will leave START = False until the VM start exits. All of this behavior is hard-coded.\n\n</p><p>There are situations where the admin may want jobs running on both the host and VM startds, particularly on multi-core machines. The only-one-startd-can-run-jobs behavior should be removed from the startd, replaced with a more flexible policy system.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Dec-01 15:36", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jul-14 17:20", "fixed_version": "2009-Jul-14 17:20", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "VM", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "purdue", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
