{"id": 6038, "title": "Ticket #6038: Reimplement EC2 package.", "description": "<blockquote>\nReimplement the EC2 package to install an extra initscript (or whatever systemd calls them now) to do the per-instance configuration we recommend for EC2.  (It should do the configuration unconditionally, rather than worry about caching.)  This eliminates the need for any change to the base HTCondor config, doesn't depend on any subtleties in the param system, eliminates a variety of security concerns, and works without having to restart HTCondor.\n\n<p>The initscript needs to make sure that any config file it downloads has the appropriate ownership and permissions.\n\n</p><p>See the parent ticket for more details.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Jun-03 10:02:26 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nThis work completed under tickets <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6202\" title=\"Create Annex RPM/deb\">#6202</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=7043\" title=\"Create Annex-ec2 .deb\">#7043</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=7084\" title=\"Add htcondor-ec2 deb to stable\">#7084</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Jun-03 10:02", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2016-Dec-02 16:06", "fixed_version": "2016-Dec-02 16:06", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#6034", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tim@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
