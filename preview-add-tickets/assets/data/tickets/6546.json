{"id": 6546, "title": "Ticket #6546: Investigate custom machine resource monitor behavior in edge cases", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe need to find out what happens to custom machine resource monitors (specifically, the contents of the startd's extra ads) when HTCondor is reconfigured.  We should document the behavior as soon as possible; we can decide later what to do if the behavior is undesirable.\n\n<p>We also need to verify that a continuous cron job which crashes and restarts is not handled differently than a periodic cron job (that is, its \"extra\" ads are maintained).\n\n</p><p>We also need to test that usage reporting functions properly when claims are reused.  We may also or alternatively need to test that starting a job on a slot with large Uptime* value(s) works properly.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2019-Apr-22 15:09", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Jan-25 19:29", "fixed_version": "2018-Jan-25 19:29", "broken_version": "v080707", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#6477", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
