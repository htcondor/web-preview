We converted to the new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SimpleJob\" title=\"Simple Job\">SimpleJob</a></span> with a no_wait mode.\nAlso made it much quieter by adding a verbose arg to CondorTest::GetJobStatus.\nIt is still a little loud but in places other then the 12 tests.\n\n<p>The tests which use the worker modules have to remove the jobs that the worked module started in two personals. We also remove all the personals with the single call to CondorTest::EndTest(); Much cleaned up. We dusted off the cmd_status_shows-help.\n\n</p><p>This allowed the deletion of 8 files</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nIn cmd_status_shows-help, I discovered that runCondorTool which is extensibly used\nwill hang under windows and active perl if there is no standard input.
