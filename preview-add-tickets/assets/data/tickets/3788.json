Because spaces are as well (?!), we should change the list separator to a pipe before somebody gets bitten by this.\n\n</p><p>This will require changing the gahp client to call escapeGahpString() on each security group name.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Nov-07 16:58:54 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nEC2 \"classic\" security group names are restricted to \"ASCII characters\".  Testing indicates that Amazon ignores leading and trailing whitespace (convenient, since <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StringList\" title=\"String List\">StringList</a></span> does as well), but that will mean it's not simple to allow arbitrary security group names without doing something like \"+SecurityGroupName_1 = foo |, ]\" as the interface, which is distressing.  Reducing to priority 5 until someone actually complains about it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-10 21:09:45 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nWhat about <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> lists?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-11 10:05:32 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<em>What about <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> lists?</em>\n\n<p>A good idea, and probably the least-awful of our options, but since the submit file syntax is not <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span>, I'm a little wary of just declaring it to be that simple.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-May-26 14:34", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jul-17 15:50", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-17 15:50", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#3787", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
