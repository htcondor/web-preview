When determining the path of the job's executable in Scheduler::start_sched_universe_job(), the schedd assumes Cmd contains the full path to the file.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Aug-17 15:03:07 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nFix committed to V7_6-branch for 7.6.4.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Aug-17 15:10:59 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>REVIEWED, LOOKS GOOD</strong></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Aug-17 14:39</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=26826\">[26826]</a></span>: Fix scheduler universe jobs with spooled files. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2396\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2396'); return false;\" title=\"Scheduler universe jobs can't run if executable is spooled\">#2396</a></span> If a job has its files spooled, the Cmd attribute will be the basename of the executable.
