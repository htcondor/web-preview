This would be distinct from the transfer_input_files - the directory to be created wouldn't exist on the submit host when the job is submitted. For example:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  My_output_dir = batch_$(Cluster)/run_$(Process)\n  Create_scratch_subdir = $(output_dir)\n  Remote_initialdir = $(output_dir)\n  Transfer_output_files = batch_$(Cluster)\n</pre>\n\n<p>The create_scratch_subdir would be parsed in the same manner as transfer_input_files, as a comma-separated list. Specifying an absolute path would throw an error.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Oct-07 10:23", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Sep-30 10:23", "fixed_version": "2016-Sep-30 10:23", "broken_version": "v080507", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "s8740", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
