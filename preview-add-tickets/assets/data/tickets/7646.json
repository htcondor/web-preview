Tons of old and irrelevant (and/or incorrect) stuff about the same topics should be removed.\n\n<p>Specifically for these tickets:\n\n</p><p><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7376\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7376'); return false;\" title=\"Add support for Kerberos and AFS creds for running job\">#7376</a></span> - Add support for Kerberos and AFS creds for running job\n\n</p><p><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7624\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7624'); return false;\" title=\"clean up client to CredD interface for user impersonation\">#7624</a></span> - clean up client to CredD interface for user impersonation\n\n</p><p><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7462\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7462'); return false;\" title=\"Different token types should be distinguished in the cred dir\">#7462</a></span> - Different token types should be distinguished in the cred dir\n\n</p><p><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7484\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7484'); return false;\" title=\"oauth credentials are swept too quickly\">#7484</a></span> - oauth credentials are swept too quickly</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Dec-29 11:40:08 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nWhy was this ticket resolved?
