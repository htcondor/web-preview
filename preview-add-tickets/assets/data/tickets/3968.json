{"id": 3968, "title": "Ticket #3968: Nested ads not detected properly by ClassAd caching code", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> caching code, a nested ad cannot be cached and shared across multiple enclosing ads. This is because the nested ad contains a pointer to the enclosing ad for its parent scope. This pointer needs to be set properly for attribute references to resolve properly during expression evaluation.\n\n<p>CachedExprEnvelope::cache() checks whether the value of an attribute is a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> and doesn't cache it. But if the value contains a nested ad, it does cache it.\n\n</p><p>For example, this attribute/value pair will be cached: <code>A=[Z=User].Z</code>\nThis should evaluate to the value of the <code>User</code> attribute in the enclosing ad, if it's defined. If caching is enabled, it always evaluates to Undefined.\n\n</p><p>The caching code needs to examine the entire expression tree to look for any occurrences of a nested ad and not cache if one is found.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Oct-03 16:48", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Oct-03 16:47", "fixed_version": "2013-Oct-03 16:47", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "ClassAd", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "jfrey@cs.wisc.edu,johnkn@cs.wisc.edu,tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
