That is, if anyone on the execute machine steals the chirp token (which is in a file), they can read an write any file on the submit machine as the user. We have talked about ways to limit this to a particular directory tree or the submitting directory, but have not implemented this.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Dec-03 22:19:33 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nHelp me understand how many of these vulnerabilities exist anyway in a hypothetically compromised execute machine (sans Chirp), given the attacker's ability to communicate with the shadow (and maybe schedd) using the starter's stolen credentials.\n\n<p>Does Chirp really add new vulnerabilities, or just make them easier to exploit?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Dec-03 22:26:27 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nAnd in another direction, how much work (i.e., days, weeks, or months) would it be to add the directory constraint you mention above -- and would that fully address the Chirp-specific vulnerability?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Dec-17 11:22:47 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nIf chirp is off, then the shadow blocks these requests, so it is a bit of a new vulnerability.\n\n<p>Implementing a fix is a couple days work.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Mar-10 10:10:42 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nClosing since Greg T. says <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7482\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7482'); return false;\" title=\"Restrict remote files access to a whitelist of directories\">#7482</a></span> is the only security issue we need to worry about.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7482\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7482'); return false;\" title=\"Restrict remote files access to a whitelist of directories\">#7482</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nRestrict remote files access to a whitelist of directories</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2020-May-04 09:50", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-Dec-03 13:05", "fixed_version": "2019-Dec-03 13:05", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "pfc", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "peter.couvares@ligo.org, anderson@ligo.caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
