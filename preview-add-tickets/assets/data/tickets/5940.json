{"id": 5940, "title": "Ticket #5940: Clean up DAG VARS parsing as related to ALL_NODES", "description": "<blockquote>\nI want to get the ALL_NODES feature into 8.5.8 with the minimum amount of additional work, so I'm leaving this as-is for right now.  Anyhow, because of that I re-used as much of the existing parsing code as possible.\n\n<p>The issue is that the existing code actually re-parses most of the VARS line for every node when ALL_NODES is specified for the node name -- it would be a lot more efficient to just parse the line once and generate some kind of list of var name/var value pairs to plug into all of the nodes.\n\n</p><p>(Hmm -- even a <strong>better</strong> thing would be to just <strong>store</strong> one copy of the var name/var value, and somehow have all of the nodes point to that.  I'm not sure how much work that would be...)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Apr-06 16:54:32 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOne thing with storing a single copy of the var name/var value -- that wouldn't work if the var value is $(JOB) or $(RETRY).</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Apr-06 17:23", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Oct-02 10:16", "fixed_version": "2016-Oct-02 10:16", "broken_version": "v080508", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "#5729", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
