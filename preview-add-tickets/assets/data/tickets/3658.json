DAGMan expects such a line to have the cluster Id in it, and does a scanf for <code>\" %d job(s) submitted to cluster %d\"</code>, and the warning line\ndoes not satisfy that.\n\n<p>Have DAGMan search for <code>\" submitted to cluster \"</code>, which will be more restrictive.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-25 22:47:12 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nMaybe we should have DAGMan unconditionally run condor_rm, rather than checking that we have submitted jobs (at line 520, in src/condor_dagman/dagman_main.cpp).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-26 20:05:55 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nYes, it seems like there are several things going on:\n<ul>\n<li>It seems like condor_submit shouldn't generate a warning in that case.\n</li><li>DAGMan should recognize that the job(s) actually got submitted.\n</li><li>The jobs weren't removed at the end.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Maybe we should have DAGMan always do a condor_rm of any child jobs at the end (or at least if anything went wrong).  The down side is that doing that will put more load on the schedd, so I think we should consider whether we want to always do it, and maybe also have another config knob (yay!) to turn that off.\n\n</p><p>I guess the thing is, even if condor_submit shouldn't generate a warning in this case, I imagine there are \"legitimate\" warnings that will cause similar problems -- so having DAGMan be fussier with what it recognizes in the condor_submit output would probably be good.  I guess maybe something else to do would be to get the actual exit code of condor_submit, and compare that to whether we thought the output was okay...\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-26 20:08:01 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, duh -- condor_submit is complaining because it's \"err\" not \"error\" -- so it <strong>is</strong> a legitimate warning in this case.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-28 14:47:16 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nTo ask a dumb question - why does DAGMan uses condor_submit instead of invoking the C++ API directly?  Historical?  Clever design decision that's eluding me?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-03 11:04:58 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed onto <code>V8_0-gittrac_3658-branch</code>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-03 14:11:07 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nThe post script in the B node for this DAG is supposed to succeed the node, but it never runs when the job fails!  Is this a regression?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-03 14:15:30 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nOK, so <code>DAGMAN_ABORT_ON_SCARY_SUBMIT</code> short circuits the \"always run post script\" code.  Maybe this is not a regression; is it documented anywhere?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-03 14:18:25 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nDAGMAN_ABORT_ON_SCARY_SUBMIT is documented in the config section.  It doesn't explicitly say that this overrides running the POST script -- but I guess I would consider \"aborting\" to mean that DAGMan immediately goes away...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-07 15:35:46 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong class=\"two\">CODE REVIEW</strong>\n\n<p>Hmm -- I'm not totally happy with this, but I'm also not sure whether it's worth making a bigger fix.  I think the parsing change is fine; the thing I'm not so happy with is condor_submit() returning true when the parsing fails.  I guess you could say that that's correct, since a job actually did get submitted.\n\n</p><p>But long-term, at least, I guess I'd be happier if condor_submit() returned one of three values:\n</p><ul>\n<li>okay\n</li><li>submit failed, should be retried\n</li><li>submit failed, but should <strong>not</strong> be retried\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>I guess my feeling at this point is to go ahead and merge this change for v8.0.1, but also make a derived ticket from this one to clean things up better...</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"tktview?tn=3685\" title=\"Clean up submit failures\">#3685</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nClean up submit failures</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"attach_get/741/3650.dag.dagman.out\">3650.dag.dagman.out</a>\n40759 bytes added by nwp on 2013-May-25 15:16:43 UTC.\n<br/>\ndagman.out file from run above.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jun-25 12:57</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=36676\">[36676]</a></span>: edit 8.0.1 version history item ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3658\" title=\"DAGMan interprets warning from submit as failure\">#3658</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jun-10 14:39</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=36525\">[36525]</a></span>: Make DAGMan be more restrictive in accepting condor_submit output <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3658\" title=\"DAGMan interprets warning from submit as failure\">#3658</a></span> condor_dagman would try to match any line containing \"cluster\" to the output \"%d job(s) submitted to cluster %d\", and fail, even though the submit actually succeeded.
