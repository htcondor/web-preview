The install location of mtcp_restart must be verified from the config &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install of the release tarball, and from the debian deb file to figure out where the Makefile in the dmtcp/condor integration package should get it. If you could make a new release of it that fixes this one bug, Nickolas can make easy progress on his work.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>Nickolas \"Nick\" Fotopoulos says:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nAlan, the mtcp_restart location is one bug, to be sure, but even when I hack around it with a symlink, I'm getting a mysterious failure that I don't know how to debug further.
