{"id": 1273, "title": "Ticket #1273: User log event timestamps are ambiguous at daylight savings-> std chg", "description": "<blockquote>\nBecause the user log event timestamps are in local time, without any indication of timezone/DST, the one hour \"overlap\" when transitioning from daylight savings to standard time in the fall causes ambiguity in interpreting the timestamps.  This could potentially cause DAGs to fail in recovery mode, if events happened during the one-hour \"window\", and multiple node job log files were used.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Mar-12 14:09", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Mar-12 14:09", "fixed_version": "2010-Mar-12 14:09", "broken_version": "v070401", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, tanneba@cs.wisc.edu, cweiss@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
