In a non-spooling condor_submit case, you're likely to run into problems if condor_submit and condor_schedd disagree on the job owner's username. The schedd will be reading and writing the job files as a different user than the one who ran condor_submit. But when the job files are spooled, it's ok for these usernames to be different, as all files are sent over the network. And when submitting to a remote machine, it's much more likely that the usernames will be different.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 10:11:14 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nProposal sounds good to me.  I can confirm that adding +Owner=UNDEFINED manually to the submit file also fixes the issue.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 12:49:10 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\njfrey's suggestion above sounds good to me as well, plus it is a tiny/simple change\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-19 05:48:51 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\n@jfrey what cases stop us from having condor_submit always set Owner=UNDEFINED?\n\n<p>Possibly hostbased auth or special@host mappings (special =? {anonymous, ssl, gsi, condor_pool})\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-19 09:39:12 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm concerned about the non-spooling case where the submitter is expecting to be mapped to their own username, but isn't due to a misconfiguration. The user is likely to run into trouble if the schedd is reading/writing job files as a different user. I'm open to the idea of letting the submission proceed in this case if condor_submit prints a warning.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Mar-14 11:57</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=35159\">[35159]</a></span>: minor editing of 7.9.5 version history item. ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3370\" title=\"condor_submit attempts (incorrectly) to set remote owner\">#3370</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Mar-04 17:25</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=35059\">[35059]</a></span>: condor_submit should allow schedd to set Owner for remote submits. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3370\" title=\"condor_submit attempts (incorrectly) to set remote owner\">#3370</a></span> When spooling files with condor_submit, set Owner=Undefined in the job ad.
