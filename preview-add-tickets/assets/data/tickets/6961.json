For instance, running 'condor_gpu_discovery -extra -dynamic -prop' on a system with NVidia drivers but without CUDA installed will fail to determine the CUDA runtime version (of course), but print a message while doing so that will prevent the other information from making it into the machine ad.\n\n<p>The bug may be as simple as changing g_config_syntax to be initialized to 1, but I'll let TJ decide.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Mar-19 18:16:12 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThis may only be fixed for 8.8.2 if it's a simple as changing the variable initialization; it's otherwise rather close to the code freeze.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Oct-12 10:02", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Mar-19 18:15", "fixed_version": "2019-Mar-19 18:15", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
