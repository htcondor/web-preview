Creation of a directory occurs in two steps.\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>Create the directory as root.\n</li><li>Use chown() to give the directory the correct ownership.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>If a problem occurs and the operation fails, it can leave behind the root-owned directory created in step 1.\n\n</p><p>As part of looking at this issue I'd like to reconsider whether root-ownership of the EXECUTE directory is strictly needed. If not, we could do away with the Switchboard mkdir operation altogether.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:20", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-26 09:51", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-26 09:51", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
