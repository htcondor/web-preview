This would list all the cron jobs.\n\n<p>There are two types of \"cron\" jobs:\n - jobs that have one of the Cron* attributes set (cronweek, cronhour, etc)\n - jobs that use a deferral time to restart every so often\n\n</p><p>I'd like to know about both types of jobs, but maybe it is not appropriate for the deferral jobs to be in the cron output?\n\n</p><p>The default format to display information about these jobs should not be the standard condor_q output.  As a possible improvement, here is what I do in RSV. I use \"condor_q -l\" to determine a bunch of information about the job and output in the following format, notably including the \"Next Run Time\".\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">[kronenfe@osg-edu osg]$ rsv-control -j\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n     ID OWNER      ST NEXT RUN TIME   METRIC\n  288.0 rsv        I  12-05 18:15     org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry\n  289.0 rsv        I  12-06 01:12     org.osg.local.containercert-expiry\n&lt;snip&gt;\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Dec-07 15:42:40 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nWhat's \"METRIC\"?</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-23 09:45", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Dec-05 16:31", "fixed_version": "2011-Dec-05 16:31", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "kronenfe", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
