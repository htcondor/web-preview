{"id": 2320, "title": "Ticket #2320: Improve security configuration in 7.7.x", "description": "<blockquote>\nPeople, including us, frequently have trouble correctly configuring Condor to use strong authentication. There are many parameters that must be set correctly. Any mistake can result in an insecure pool or a pool where daemons can't talk to each other, and debugging the mistake can be very difficult. See ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"tktview?tn=2319\" title=\"Improve security configuration in 7.6.x\">#2319</a></span> for an example.\n\n<p>We need to make security configuration easier. Ideally, a user would set one parameter to enable the common strong security configurations for their pool (e.g. use a pool password for all daemon-to-daemon communications).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jul-19 14:26:41 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Jaime,\n\n<p>I've actually been thinking about this for awhile.
