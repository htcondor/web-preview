{"id": 3384, "title": "Ticket #3384: Verify HTCondor-CE functionality", "description": "<blockquote>\nVerify that HTCondor components of HTCondor-CE setup work as needed. Of particular interest are job proxy handling  by HTCondor-C, job router, and blahp, and job lease handling by HTCondor-C. These features should be tested in an environment that resembles the HTCondor-CE setup as closely as possible. This includes a multi-user, root-based installation with HTCondor-C, job router, and blahp all chained together.\n\n<p>Where appropriate and feasible, regression tests should be written for critical pieces of functionality.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Feb-25 11:16:24 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nThe only thing I'm aware of is that the HTCondor-C job lease does not appear to be functioning for HTCondor-CE.  Everything else has been verified.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3383\" title=\"Blahp requires HOME to be set in the environment\">#3383</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nBlahp requires HOME to be set in the environment</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3395\" title=\"Condor-C constantly refreshes proxy when delegated lifetime unlimited\">#3395</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nCondor-C constantly refreshes proxy when delegated lifetime unlimited</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2014-Sep-17 13:27", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Dec-17 12:42", "fixed_version": "2012-Dec-17 12:42", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#3275", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "blin@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
