{"id": 3301, "title": "Ticket #3301: Improve gridmanager reaction to gahp failing to start", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhenever a GAHP server exits unexpectedly, the gridmanager exits as well. This makes recovery in the gridmanager easier and works well enough if a GAHP failure is a rare event. With BOSCO, we start GAHPs on remote machines over SSH. Now, GAHP failures can be very common, caused by things such as network failure, remote machine failure, invalid ssh credentials, and incorrect platform for the remote binaries. The gridmanager's suicide reaction can now be overkill.\n\n<p>An easy improvement is to have the gridmanager not suicide if the GAHP fails to start up properly. Instead, the gridmanager can put the affected jobs on hold with a meaningful hold reason.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jan-11 12:11</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=34619\">[34619]</a></span>: minor grammar edit of 7.9.3 version history item ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3301\" title=\"Improve gridmanager reaction to gahp failing to start\">#3301</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jan-10 14:26</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=34598\">[34598]</a></span>: Docs for gahp startup failure improvements. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3301\" title=\"Improve gridmanager reaction to gahp failing to start\">#3301</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Nov-02 16:43</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=33975\">[33975]</a></span>: Improve gridmanager reaction to gahp failing to start. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3301\" title=\"Improve gridmanager reaction to gahp failing to start\">#3301</a></span> If a gahp fails to start properly, the gridmanager will now put the affected jobs on hold and continue running.
