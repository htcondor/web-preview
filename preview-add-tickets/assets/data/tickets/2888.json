The code will ignore records that don't have both of the required fields, and tolerate records that have the fields in either order.\n\n<p>It might be good to have it also print out a message when it sees records that it doesn't expect, or at least when it gets a response that contains ONLY records that it doesn't recognise.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Mar-16 13:14</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=30945\">[30945]</a></span>: Make gridmanager more tolerant of nordugrid ldap responses. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2888\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2888'); return false;\" title=\"Unexpected response from nordugrid ldap server can kill gridmanager\">#2888</a></span> When querying a nordugrid ldap server for job statuses, the gridmanager expected all requested attributes to be present and in a certain order in each record.
