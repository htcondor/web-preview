Doing so in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DedicatedScheduler\" title=\"Dedicated Scheduler\">DedicatedScheduler</a></span> setting causes jobs to not run.  removing the \"adesmet@\" allows them to run.\n\n</p><p>Proposed fix: Strike the following from the manual:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  If running personal Condor, the name of the scheduler includes the user name it was started as, so the configuration appears as:\n</pre>\n\n<p></p><pre>  DedicatedScheduler = \"DedicatedScheduler@username@full.host.name\"\n  STARTD_ATTRS = $(STARTD_ATTRS), DedicatedScheduler\n</pre>\n\n<p>gthain: Can you verify the above?
