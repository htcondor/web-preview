{"id": 4812, "title": "Ticket #4812: Be able to dump DAG node status file to dagman.out for testing", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt would be nice to have an option to dump the DAG node status file to the dagman.out file, so we have a record of how it changed over time to help with debugging.  There's a compile-time option in the code to write to a new status file each time, but that still gets overwritten if you are in recovery mode.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Mar-27 13:55:50 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOr maybe a better way to do this is to have an \"append\" option for the node status file.  (Maybe just specify \"NODE_STATUS_FILE &lt;file&gt; APPEND\" in the DAG.)</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Mar-27 13:55", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jan-06 18:18", "fixed_version": "2015-Jan-06 18:18", "broken_version": "v080302", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
