(Up to this point, it's very similar to what we need to do for the jobstate.log file for Pegasus.)  The difference from jobstate.log is that Miron wants the user to be able to designate certain nodes as \"important\", and only those nodes would have information in this special log file.  (The log file would be designed for a human, as opposed to jobstate.log, which is really designed for Pegasus to parse.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-May-05 13:57:37 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nIs there any reason we couldn't write a tool which parses a log file and emits the information necessary in the right format?</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:21", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-17 15:04", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-17 15:04", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
