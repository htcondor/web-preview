We'll have to do some thinking\nabout how things should work, and where the detection should happen.  For\nexample, if the problem is that the workflow log is on a read-only\nfilesystem, DAGMan itself could detect that before submitting any jobs.\nIf the dagman.out file is on a read-only filesystem, I think that would have\nto get detected in daemoncore.\n\n<p>Kent</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Sep-22 11:51:34 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nIn-person discussion Kent+Tom.
