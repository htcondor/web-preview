{"id": 5186, "title": "Ticket #5186: Starter should log by default allowed CPU, Mem, Disk", "description": "<blockquote>\nGlideinwms uses the information logged into the starter log to gather useful stats like, number of jobs ran by a glidein, good-put, bad-put etc. Starter does not log in its log by default max allowed resources like CPU, MEMORY and DISK to job. In case of single core glideins the info could be reliably extracted/assumed but not in case of the multicore glideins. This info is important in case of multicore glideins and without this, it is not possible to reliably compute the good-put/efficiency of jobs. A single line logging this info by default after the job starts will be good enough.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2015-Jul-31 10:33", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jul-31 10:33", "fixed_version": "2015-Jul-31 10:33", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "parag", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "parag@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
