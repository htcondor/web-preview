{"id": 4918, "title": "Ticket #4918: Add network condition as an criterion into HTCondor matching process", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrent HTCondor matchmaking process does not consider the network conditions between different cluster sites. Thus it is highly possible that the computing capacity satisfies the job's requirement, while the bad network throughput between the submission site and execution site results in a long time spent in file transfers. This will decrease the overall goodput of the HTC system. We propose to integrate network conditions into HTCondor matchmaking algorithm to improve the matchmaking decision, in which less overall time should be spent on file transfer and the overall system goodput could be improved.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "experimental", "last_change": "2015-Mar-02 11:36", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Mar-02 11:36", "fixed_version": "2015-Mar-02 11:36", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "zzhang", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zzhang", "rust": "", "customer_group": "lark", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zzhang@cse.unl.edu, bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
