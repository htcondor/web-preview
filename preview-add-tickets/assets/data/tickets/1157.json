It says:\n\n</p><p>Examples\n\n</p><p>To remove all jobs of a user named Mary that are not currently running:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  % condor_rm Mary -constraint Activity!=\\\"Busy\\\"\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that quotation marks must be escaped with the backslash characters for most shells.\n\n</p><p>This just won't work  \"Activity\" is an attribute of machines, not jobs, so the actual command would be something like\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  % condor_rm Mary -constraint 'JobStatus =!= 2'</pre>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nCan't have both a user and a -constraint specified.  condor_rm gives an error message to this if it is tried.  Example has been corrected.
