It wasn't hard.\n\n</p><p>I'm now working on the full port.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Apr-01 15:37:01 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is stalled due to not having enough time to work on it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 14:22:44 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI have time now. I've started hacking.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 16:09:11 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nIt seems the rhel 6 fixes made the externals compile for this platform. Also, it appears that deb 6 x86_64 was on the master, so I'm enabling it on the V7_6-branch too with full externals.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 16:29:16 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI finished the clipped port with all externals and put it into the nightlies for V7_6-branch and the master. If it passes for a couple of days, then the clipped port is finished.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-02 14:34:58 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI noticed the deb 6 port was failing in creating the native packages and this\nhad something to do with libvirt. After consulting with Jamie, it was determined that two things happened, and one masked the other.\n\n<p>First, a while ago, libvirt was made to be dynamically linked instead of statically. This is the change that actually broke deb 6 native packaging since deb 6 has libvirt in its repo but it isn't installed by default. This caused the native packaging tool to fail.\n\n</p><p>Second, in the same day the above change was made, an externals caching error arose which masked the first error. This took a while to get fixed. After it was fixed the original libvirt problem became visible.\n\n</p><p>So, the fix is to tell NMI that they need to install the libvirt debian package on deb 6 so the dependency manager finds it. Scot Kronenfeld is taking care of this request. Hopefully in a day or two the packaging problem will vanish and deb 6 will be ready to go.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-19 13:57:17 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThe deb 6 port was ready to go and has been building for a while.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-19 13:58:49 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI've started upon the full port for the Debian 6 x86_64 port. I've figured out how to download and patch the glibc required for this distro. It turns out we still need the enable-static-nss patch. Now I'm fixing the Condor source code itself to compile with stduniv. Hopefully I'll finish that today.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-19 16:40:13 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, the source compiles, and the test suite compiles. Now I'm getting ready to run the test suite itself and see what happens.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-20 19:17:15 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nAfter some pounding upon a subtle \"do what I mean\" implementation of open3() by the perl developers (if the command \"looks complex\" wrap it in /bin/sh, otherwise just exec it!) which was squashing a signal exit code into a non-signal exit code, I finally have the whole test suite passing. It will be checked in soon.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-28 12:04:17 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThis port is finished and in the nightly builds. The stduniv tests look stable.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Jul-21 12:03</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=22567\">[22567]</a></span>: ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1999\" title=\"Perform Debian 6 full port of Condor\">#1999</a></span> Added the full port of x86_64_deb_6.0-updated into the nightly builds.
