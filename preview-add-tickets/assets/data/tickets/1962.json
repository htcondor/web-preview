A simple de-ref of a pointer that <em>may</em> be null is the problem. this is an easy fix.\n\n<p>However, when you stop the master using <code>net stop condor</code> <strong>OR</strong> <code>condor_off -master</code> DaemonCore::Send_Signal is recursing in a way that does not appear to be intentional.   the recursion does stop after going about 7 levels but it is likely that there is still a bug in the way shutdown is handled.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-23 09:19:23 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nverified fix on 3/23/2011</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Mar-22 15:48</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=21116\">[21116]</a></span>: fix for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1962\" title=\"win7 net stop condor == hard kill\">#1962</a></span>, net stop condor command is crashing inside the handler for Service Stop. pidinfo is allowed to be NULL in DaemonCore::Send_Signal, but the test for child_session_id did not test pidinfo before using it.
