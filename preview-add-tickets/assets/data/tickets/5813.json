If it is, it should defer accepting new connections until it has an FD (or MAX_ACCEPTS_PER_CYCLE?) free to do so.\n\n<p>(It may have to be two FDs per MAX_ACCEPT, because the shared port daemon both accept()s a connection and almost immediately opens the corresponding domain socket (or whatever) to shove that FD down.)\n\n</p><p>(Alternately, the shared port daemon should check before that open(), as well.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jul-28 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jul-27 15:49", "fixed_version": "2016-Jul-27 15:49", "broken_version": "v080400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonSharedP", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5801", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
