{"id": 7288, "title": "Ticket #7288: Prefer Blowfish over Triple DES", "description": "<blockquote>\nOn a busy submit machine, many encrypted file transfers may consume significant CPU time. The default encryption method, Triple DES, has been deprecated for a few years now. Blowfish gives comparable protection while consuming much less CPU. Both are susceptible to birthday attacks due to their 64-bit block size. Blowfish is not recommended to encrypt files over 4GiB. This is the best we can do until we can use AES.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Oct-01 17:03:00 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong>:  Looks good.  I was concerned that this could potentially break compatibility for non-negotiated sessions between old and new versions of HTCondor.  That's not a concern.  The method is chosen by the execute side and propagated through the ClaimID to the submit side, so they always agree.\n\n<p>Side note:  Why not delete all the test configs and have them just use the default?</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Oct-15 16:08</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=58182\">[58182]</a></span>: Version history for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7288\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7288'); return false;\" title=\"Prefer Blowfish over Triple DES\">#7288</a></span>  (By Tim Theisen )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Sep-26 14:16</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=57930\">[57930]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7288\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7288'); return false;\" title=\"Prefer Blowfish over Triple DES\">#7288</a></span>) Prefer Blowfish over Triple DES for encryption  (By Tim Theisen )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Oct-15 21:08", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-Sep-26 14:08", "fixed_version": "2019-Sep-26 14:08", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tim", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
