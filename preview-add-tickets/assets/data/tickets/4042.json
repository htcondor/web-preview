This is to help resolve utilization/performance problems.\n\n</p><p>...\n\n</p><p>Ideally what I'm trying to get in a Phase4Duration breakdown are answers to\nquestions like:\n\n</p><p>What percentage time is being spent in the negotiator vs. in communication with\nthe schedd's?  If the negotiator is  spending all it's Phase4 time not\ncommunicating, there's likely a code problem.\n\n</p><p>How much time am I spending in each schedd?  Is there a particular schedd that\nI'm spending all of my time in?  Was I experiencing communication problems with\nthat schedd in addition to spending lots of time with it, and how much wait\ntime was introduced due to communications recovery?\n\n</p><p>How much time is being lost to rejections vs. valid matches?\n\n</p><p>Today we just get 1 number, total time spent.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Nov-05 15:16:45 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nCombined this RFE into <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"reviewdesign\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4041\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4041'); return false;\" title=\"RFE: Provide additional statistics and counters in negotiator\">#4041</a></span> and renamed <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"reviewdesign\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4041\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4041'); return false;\" title=\"RFE: Provide additional statistics and counters in negotiator\">#4041</a></span> to be 'add negotiator statistics and counters', thus I am abandoning this ticket.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Nov-05 15:17", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2013-Nov-04 16:33", "fixed_version": "2013-Nov-04 16:33", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "eje", "derived_from": "", "creator": "eje", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "eje@cs.wisc.edu, matt@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com, gthain@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu, jthomas@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
