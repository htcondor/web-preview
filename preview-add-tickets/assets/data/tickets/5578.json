{"id": 5578, "title": "Ticket #5578: condor_gangliad stopped pulling data from restarted collector", "description": "<blockquote>\nAt 07:36:52 this morning the DoIT central manager (<code>condor1.doit.wisc.edu</code>) restarted after an automated upgrade.  The condor_gangliad daemon that is responsible for pulling the DoIT cm (GANGLIAD_DOIT) runs on <code>monitor0.chtc.wisc.edu</code>.  At the time of the DoIT collector restart it began failing to pull new data, and continued to fail until I restarted the condor_gangliad at around 15:42 PM.  You can see the discontinuity here:\n\n<p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://monitor0.chtc.wisc.edu/grafana/dashboard/db/doit-pool?from=1458726752882&amp;to=1458769952882\">http://monitor0.chtc.wisc.edu/grafana/dashboard/db/doit-pool?from=1458726752882&amp;to=1458769952882</a>\n\n</p><p>Here is the email exchange between myself and Dale Carder, who admins the DOIT central manager:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>Thus spake moate@cs.wisc.edu (moate@cs.wisc.edu) on Wed, Mar 23, 2016 at 01:58:27PM -0500:\n&gt; It looks like the DoIT pool central manager is unreachable (just\n&gt; HTCondor, the machine is ping-able).
