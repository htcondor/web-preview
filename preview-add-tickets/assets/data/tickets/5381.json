{"id": 5381, "title": "Ticket #5381: Make DAGMan warnings more visible", "description": "<blockquote>\nI think it would be really good if we could make DAGMan warnings more visible.  Right now they're just buried in the dagman.out file, which I'll bet most users don't look at unless they have a fatal error -- which means that the warnings are not very useful.\n\n<p>I'm not sure what the right way is to do this -- probably needs some brainstorming.  An obvious idea is emailing the user each time there's a warning, but in some circumstances that could result in them getting thousands of emails, which we don't want.  Maybe we could batch emails together?  Or maybe that's totally the wrong approach.  Maybe we could create an html file that has error and warning messages, and encourage them to point their web browser at it?\n\n</p><p>Anyhow, something I'd like to think about.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Nov-10 10:52", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Nov-10 10:52", "fixed_version": "2015-Nov-10 10:52", "broken_version": "v080501", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
