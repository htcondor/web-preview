We can probably do this by simply looking for a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LastRejMatchTime\" title=\"Last Rej Match Time\">LastRejMatchTime</a></span>, not there? not considered yet!\n\n</p><p>Second, consider 2392.1 and the second -bet, we have information about why the job isn't running, we even report it, but we still say the job is not running for Unknown Reasons. This second piece is a critical observation, the system has given us information about what is going on, we should use it, and maybe the system should give more information.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Dec-01 10:52:23 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nAlso, we should deal with the fact that condor_q -better-analyze doesn't deal w/ classad functions gracefully - errors get reported during the analysis.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-25 16:31:14 by willb:</em> <br/>\n\nI expect that at least the first part of this ticket is on track for 2/4.

Greg and I are going to chat about other cases later.  Since the simplest case is absolutely the most common, I'm inclined to mark this ticket resolved at this point and consider other analysis improvements in the post-7.6 timeframe.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Mar-30 11:14</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=21196\">[21196]</a></span>: Cosmetic and usability cleanup to condor_q -bet output.
