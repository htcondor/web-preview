This doesn't work; comments are only valid is # is the first non-whitespace character in the line.  So Condor included qux, as well as \"#\" as a hostname.  This wouldn't have been too bad, but the user reports: \"condor suddenly polls our nameservers for a host named \"#\" at a rather high rate (roughly 1000 requests per minute).\"\n\n</p><p>It is highly likely that other invalid hostnames, possibly all non-resolving hostnames, will cause the effect.  Under no circumstances should we be spamming a nameserver repeated for a non-resolving address.\n\n</p><p>User is using Condor 7.6.4-1 from the squeeze repository <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/debian/\">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/debian/</a> on Ubuntu Oneiric 11.10.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Nov-15 16:25", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Nov-15 16:25", "fixed_version": "2011-Nov-15 16:25", "broken_version": "v070604", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "a22800", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
