{"id": 6334, "title": "Ticket #6334: Only SIGHUP the CREDMON if contents of SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY chnged", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhile working in other code, I noticed that when the <code>CredD</code> does its \"optimization\" of not updating a credential in the <code>SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY</code> if it already exists, even when the credential is not updated it still sends a <code>SIGHUP</code> to the <code>CREDMON</code>.  This potentially creates extra work for the <code>CREDMON</code> and depending on the implementation may be causing extra load on the <code>KDC</code> or other services as well.\n\n<p>I don't believe anyone relies on that behavior.  However, the code changes are unfortunately not as simple as you'd hope and so I am proposing this for the 8.7.X developer series instead of stable.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Aug-22 16:17</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=52152\">[52152]</a></span>: Only send SIGHUP to CREDMON if any credentials were actually updated. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"review\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6334\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6334'); return false;\" title=\"Only SIGHUP the CREDMON if contents of SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY chnged\">#6334</a></span>  (By zmiller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2017-Oct-09 17:20", "status": "review", "created": "2017-Jul-07 10:25", "fixed_version": "2017-Jul-07 10:25", "broken_version": "v080600", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cern", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": "20170811"}
