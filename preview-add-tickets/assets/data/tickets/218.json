Most of these are trivial to fix.  Once these are resolved, we should run in priv sep by default if DAEMON_LIST does not include the schedd.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Aug-27 13:14", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Feb-17 15:28", "fixed_version": "2009-Feb-17 15:28", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
