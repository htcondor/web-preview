{"id": 1033, "title": "Ticket #1033: Quickfix to have the master run kbdd on Windows on an execute node", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe installer needs a minor modification to have the master start up condor_kbdd.  This is a temporary fix until the kbdd's logging can be routed to not use the c:\\condor\\log directory, as it has insufficient privileges to do so when running under a regular user account.  This ends up completely removing any sort of keyboard activity checking.  At least this way, the keyboard checking will still work under XP.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Nov-19 07:12:52 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nWhat version did this change go into?</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Dec-09 18:22</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=16542\">[16542]</a></span>: Modify the installer to have condor_kbdd started by the master.
