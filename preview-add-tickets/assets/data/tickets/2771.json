The only solution currently available is to run Condor as a personal Condor under a logged in user.  This is not acceptable for many users.

Condor already has this, the slot user account.\n</li><li>Determine if the slot user can be used in conjunction with specifying session 1 when creating a process using <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CreateProcessAsUser\" title=\"Create Process As User\">CreateProcessAsUser</a></span>.  So far most of the example code out there relies on the inherited system account, which we do not want a job to have.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Reference: <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=93450\">http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=93450</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Jan-17 15:05", "status": "defer", "created": "2012-Jan-17 14:59", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-17 14:59", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "ziliang", "derived_from": "", "creator": "ziliang", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
