{"id": 2939, "title": "Ticket #2939: [Debian] Scripts with language extensions in sbin", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe Debian packaging rules forbid filename extensions indicating a specific scripting language for binaries in the system PATH. In Condor, condor_vm_vmware.pl and grid_monitor.sh run afoul of this. The proposed solution is to rename them. But since their locations are set in the Condor config file, we will need to have symlinks for the old names to avoid breaking installations that are upgrading from older versions. The Debian package will need a patch that omits the symlinks.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nResolving, as this is a dup of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2940\" title=\"[Debian] Scripts with language extensions in sbin\">#2940</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Apr-11 12:36", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Apr-11 12:03", "fixed_version": "2012-Apr-11 12:03", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#2058", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "jfrey@cs.wisc.edu,michael.hanke@gmail.com", "due_date": ""}
