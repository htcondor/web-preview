{"id": 457, "title": "Ticket #457: NETWORK_INTERFACE should trump IP rewriting", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen Condor transmits its contact address, it rewrites the IP address to match the IP address of the interface upon which it is talking.  This messed up something Todd Miller was doing because the interface upon which it was talking happened to be NATed.  In his case, NETWORK_INTERFACE was set to the public IP address and if Condor had just sent that without any rewriting, everything would have worked.  He was able to work around the problem by changing the default route.\n\n<p>From this case we concluded that if the admin explicitly sets NETWORK_INTERFACE, then Condor should just send that without any rewriting.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Jul-27 13:04</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=25583\">[25583]</a></span>: Documented fix for NETWORK_INTERFACE and auto-address-rewriting. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=457\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('457'); return false;\" title=\"NETWORK_INTERFACE should trump IP rewriting\">#457</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Jul-27 12:58</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=18634\">[18634]</a></span>: Disable address rewriting if NETWORK_INTERFACE is defined. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=457\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('457'); return false;\" title=\"NETWORK_INTERFACE should trump IP rewriting\">#457</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jul-31 11:59", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-May-06 17:33", "fixed_version": "2009-May-06 17:33", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "danb@cs.wisc.edu,tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
