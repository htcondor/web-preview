{"id": 7791, "title": "Ticket #7791: Windows daemons can't run Python scripts correctly.", "description": "<blockquote>\nHTCondor allows the user to call scripts as part of its configuration, including, but not limited to, MACHINE_RESOURCE_INVENTORY_&lt;NAME&gt;, startd cron jobs, and schedd cron jobs.  Presently, on Windows, calling scripts doesn't work at all -- see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"tktview?tn=7790\" title=\"Windows my_popen() can't run scripts\">#7790</a></span>.  However, even if HTCondor called the registered handler for .py, there's no a priori reason to believe that the Python thereby invoked will be able to load any HTCondor bindings, much less the ones associated with the currently running instance.  It would therefore be useful and convenient to be able to configure HTCondor's handling of Python scripts independent of the registry.\n\n<p>We presume this can safely implemented in my_popen() only.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Aug-07 14:54", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Aug-07 14:28", "fixed_version": "2020-Aug-07 14:28", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
