{"id": 386, "title": "Ticket #386: BIND_ALL_INTERFACES always trumps NETWORK_INTERFACE", "description": "<blockquote>\nBIND_ALL_INTERFACES defaults to True, even if NETWORK_INTERFACE is set, which is strange behavior.  I think that the correct behavior should be that if NETWORK_INTERFACE is set in the configuration file / environment, BIND_ALL_INTERFACES should default to False, unless explicitly set.\n\n<p>Even better, I think that BIND_ALL_INTERFACES should be deprecated, and the following behavior should replace it:\n\n</p><p>NETWORK_INTERFACE would default to '*', which is equivalent to to 'BIND_ALL_INTERFACES = True'.  Otherwise, if NETWORK_INTERFACE is set to an IP address or interface name (i.e. \"eth0\") would be equivalent to \"\n'BIND_ALL_INTERFACES = False' and 'NETWORK_INTERFACE = &lt;name|addr&gt;' as specified.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Dec-07 10:37:06 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBen Cotton and Preston Smith at Purdue have requested that there be a way to specify which IP address to use as something like 128.210.*, because in some cases, it is awkward to have to specify an exact IP address.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Oct-16 13:24", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-15 15:57", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-15 15:57", "broken_version": "v070200", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "nleroy", "derived_from": "", "creator": "nleroy", "rust": "a19120", "customer_group": "fermi", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
