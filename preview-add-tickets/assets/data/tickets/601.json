{"id": 601, "title": "Ticket #601: Event log rotation on Win32 probably broken with >1 writer process", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom looking at the code in it's current state, it's obvious that the writer does not (and never did) close the event log file while writing (except during rotations).  Thus, if there's more than one writer process, the file will never be closed, and rotations will always fail.\n\n<p>It works on UNIX because UNIX semantics allow for rename / delete operations on open files.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jun-24 08:40:09 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nPlease fill in the version field so we know if it is 7.2.x or 7.3.x, thanks.\n\n<p>Ugh, this isn't going to be quite as easy as I had hoped...  The code isn't prepared to handle the case of the file being closed except for during initialization and rotations.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-08 12:27:01 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nI believe this is fixed...
