Each machine with this configuration must have access to the lock (the job queue) which synchronizes which single machine does run the condor_schedd daemon. This lock and the job queue must both be located in a shared file space, and is currently specified only with a file URL. The configuration specifies the shared space (SPOOL), and the URL of the lock. condor_preen is not currently aware of the lock file and will delete it if it is placed in the SPOOL directory, so be sure to add SCHEDD.lock to VALID_SPOOL_FILES .\n{endverbatim}\n\n</p><p>The example is wrong.
