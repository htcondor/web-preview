The functionality of JOB_PROXY_OVERRIDE_FILE can be better provided by submit transforms. I believe these features have not been used by anyone for a long time. We should remove them, which will simplify parts of the gridmanager code.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Dec-13 15:26:09 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThese are undocumented features, so no version history is required.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Oct-11 10:30</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=52552\">[52552]</a></span>: Remove undocumented grid-only x509 proxy features. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6438\" title=\"Remove undocumented grid-only x509 proxy features\">#6438</a></span> JOB_PROXY_OVERRIDE_FILE and \"use best proxy\" are undocumented, only work in the gridmanager, are of questionable value, and are not used by anyone to our knowledge.
