{"id": 7402, "title": "Ticket #7402: Python bindings install doesn't see changes to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe cmake code that installs the python bindings invokes setuptools by wrapping and running a command like: <code>python setup.py install --root=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} --install-lib=${C_PYTHONARCHLIB} --install-scripts=${C_BIN}</code>. This command string is parsed and coded into the resulting Makefile when cmake is run. This means that changes to any of the cmake variables (e.g. <code>${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}</code>) <em>after</em> running cmake are not seen by <code>setup.py</code>.\n\n<p>Instead, we should \"install\" the scaffolding that setuptools generates to a well-known location at build time and then use cmake's normal install behavior to copy the scaffolding at install time, since the normal install behavior can understand changes to cmake variables.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:46:37 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080906 to v080907 using ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:26", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Nov-26 12:24", "fixed_version": "2019-Nov-26 12:24", "broken_version": "v080904", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "jpatton", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jpatton", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
