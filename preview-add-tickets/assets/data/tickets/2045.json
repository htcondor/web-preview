{"id": 2045, "title": "Ticket #2045: Have gridmanager use the same Email object as the shadow", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis ticket is similar to <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1975\" title=\"Have schedd use the same Email object as the shadow\">#1975</a></span>, but the issue here is with the gridmanager instead of the schedd. Like the schedd, the gridmanager implements its own functionality for emailing the user when a job completes (basejob.cpp EmailTerminateEvent()). It should use the email object in the util lib (utils/email_cpp.cpp), just like the shadow does.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-May-09 10:30:56 by slauson:</em> <br/>\n\nResolving ticket as this work is under review in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1976\" title=\"Send email if job notification is set to Error and job goes on hold\">#1976</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-May-03 11:20", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Apr-07 15:26", "fixed_version": "2011-Apr-07 15:26", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "slauson", "derived_from": "#1976", "creator": "slauson", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
