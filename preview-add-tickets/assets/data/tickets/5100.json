{"id": 5100, "title": "Ticket #5100: condor_off -peaceful doesn't work well with DAGs", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf you do 'condor_off -peaceful' on a machine that has a running DAG, the HTCondor daemons will most likely never actually stop.  The problem is that DAGMan is running, and unless you manage to happen to do the condor_off at a point where DAGMan will eventually quit when the running jobs finish, it will stay in the running state indefinitely.\n\n<p>You can work around this by doing a condor_hold on DAGMan, so maybe 'condor_off -peaceful' should hold any scheduler-universe jobs (or condor_dagman jobs, anyhow)?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Jun-16 14:07", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jun-16 14:07", "fixed_version": "2015-Jun-16 14:07", "broken_version": "v080306", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
