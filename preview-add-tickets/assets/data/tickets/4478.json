{"id": 4478, "title": "Ticket #4478: Update web submit examples page", "description": "<blockquote>\nExample 6 on the <strong>job submission examples</strong> web page is not quite correct. It very quietly assumes a shared file system in order to work.\n\n<p>Example 7 needs a better explanation why the Requirements are to be set. Defaults assume that the matched execute machine be of the same platform as the submit machine if no OpSys/Arch are specified.  The example should state this.  Otherwise, why would this not have been necessary for the previous 6 examples?\n\n</p><p>Example 8 should not be using files named with <code>mathematica</code>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Jul-23 11:28:15 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nActually, example 6 is correct, as standard universe does not need the file transfer mechanism.  Best to explicitly state this.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2014-Aug-04 15:51", "status": "resolved", "created": "2014-Jul-22 13:45", "fixed_version": "2014-Jul-22 13:45", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
