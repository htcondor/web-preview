This certainly should not be the case and we should investigate more closely whether there are other characters causing problems.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nInterestingly, I have not been able to reproduce this problem so far. I have not tried Condor 7.4.2 yet, but with versions 7.4.4 or the current master, it just works as expected.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Aug-16 14:46", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Oct-20 17:20", "fixed_version": "2010-Oct-20 17:20", "broken_version": "v070402", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "cweiss", "derived_from": "", "creator": "cweiss", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "cweiss@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
