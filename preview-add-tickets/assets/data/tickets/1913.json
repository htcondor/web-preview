{"id": 1913, "title": "Ticket #1913: negotiator does not publish updated address", "description": "<blockquote>\nChanges to the negotiator's address are not published to the collector until the negotiator is reconfigured or restarted.  This problem was observed when using shared_port.  The negotiator started up at a time when the shared port ad file did not contain a valid address for some (unknown) reason.  The negotiator detected the problem and kept retrying until it successfully read the shared port address, but the negotiator continued to publish an incomplete address until it was restarted.\n\n<p>If the shared_port address were to change, a similar problem would happen.  The negotiator would detect the new address but would continue to advertise the original address.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Mar-01 14:24</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=25939\">[25939]</a></span>: Documented fix for negotiator address change publication. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1913\" title=\"negotiator does not publish updated address\">#1913</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Mar-01 14:17</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=25921\">[25921]</a></span>: Revert \"Documented fix for negotiator address change publication. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1913\" title=\"negotiator does not publish updated address\">#1913</a></span>\" This fix is going into 7.5.6, so I am moving the documentation there.
