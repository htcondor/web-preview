Ideally, they would like to be able to backfill these machines which poorer priority jobs, as long as they can absolutely guarantee that when work shows up for the more important slots, there is a minimal (&lt; 1 second?) latency impact on the high priority jobs.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Oct-29 10:59:06 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nThis has been temporarily implemented via two startds (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=7254\" title=\"Create plan for low-latency LIGO bayestar schedule\">#7254</a></span>) but will be implemented via one startd soon (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"tktview?tn=7350\" title=\"Allow different slots in same startd to have different BASE_CGROUPS\">#7350</a></span>).</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"tktview?tn=7350\" title=\"Allow different slots in same startd to have different BASE_CGROUPS\">#7350</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nAllow different slots in same startd to have different BASE_CGROUPS</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2019-Oct-30 09:53", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Sep-04 14:25", "fixed_version": "2019-Sep-04 14:25", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
