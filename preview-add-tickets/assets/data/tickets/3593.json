{"id": 3593, "title": "Ticket #3593: Make cluster name optional in Bosco submit files", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor Bosco installations with jobs going to a single cluster, we'd like to make the cluster name in the grid_resource submit attribute optional. We can do this without any changes to the HTCondor C/C++ source code. Making any more of the grid_resource line optional would take more work.\n\n<p>Here are the change that need to be made:\n</p><ul>\n<li>In condor_configure, when doing a Bosco installation, set BATCH_GAHP=$(REMOTE_GAHP) in the local config file.\n\n<p></p></li><li>In remote_gahp, if the cluster name argument is missing, pull it from the Bosco cluster configuration, either by call bosco_cluster -l or by reading the cluster file directly.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-May-01 17:28:35 by marco:</em> <br/>\n\nI did the changes in remote_ghap.\n\n<p>Jaime will add the line to the condor_config for BOSCO.\n\n</p><p>A missed part is how to tell HTCondor which queue (LRM) is used in the remote cluster. This is needed by the submission code. Jaime will check if there is a way to do this without the user adding it to the submit file.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-01 17:45:08 by marco:</em> <br/>\n\nHave a different idea:\nlet the user specify vanilla jobs\nHave it add +WantDirectBosco = True\nHave Bosco to write job routing rules when adding clusters.\nUse job routing to rewrite the classad and submit the job to the cluster.\n\n<p>What do you think?
