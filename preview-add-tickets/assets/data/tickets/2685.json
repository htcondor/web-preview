In practice they've overlapped, except this ticket involves the complication of heterogenous GPUs in one machine, where sometimes you might need one specific model or the other, but sometimes you can take whichever's available.  This isn't possible when they're defined as distinct resource types since you can't say \"I need 1 foo OR 1 bar\" via the request_* syntax -- and on the flip side, you can't define them all as one type and use slot attributes and job requirements to select the right kind (like you could OS or ARCH, for example) because there's no way to advertise the different attrs with dynamic slots.\n\n<p>So maybe the \"let us define custom GPU resources\" part of this ticket (which is now solved for internally GPU-homogenous machines) can be considered addressed by <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"tktview?tn=2905\" title=\"RFE: adding local resource limits to partionable slots\">#2905</a></span>, and this ticket can morph into the specific \"support for heterogeneous GPU resources in one machine\" issue, which is lower priority (maybe even priority==4 for now, I think).</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3386\" title=\"RFE: GPU discovery and ClassAd Update\">#3386</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nRFE: GPU discovery and <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> Update</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Sep-21 11:43", "status": "defer", "created": "2011-Dec-02 14:37", "fixed_version": "2011-Dec-02 14:37", "broken_version": "v070900", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "pfc", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pfcouvar@syr.edu,tstclair@redhat.com, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, eje@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
