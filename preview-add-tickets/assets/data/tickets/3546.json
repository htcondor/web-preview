{"id": 3546, "title": "Ticket #3546: Advertise CPU flags.", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn light of LIGO's recent standard universe troubles with the AVX instruction-set extensions, it has been suggested that it would be worthwhile for HTCondor to advertise the CPU flags (or equivalent).  While this could be accomplished with a startd cron job, having an official HTCondor standard would improve pool interoperability, and it's arguably HTCondor's responsibility anyway.\n\n<p>One suggestion was to extend/improve the Arch attribute much in the same spirit as <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=OpSys\" title=\"Op Sys\">OpSys</a></span>.  Another obvious option is just to advertise the CPU flags directly (e.g., cpu_has_avx = true); it probably depends on how to make writing requirements expressions the simplest.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nImplemented as part of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=3544\" title=\"no AVX machine attribute causing stduniv job resumes to fail\">#3544</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Aug-04 11:42", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Mar-19 10:11", "fixed_version": "2013-Mar-19 10:11", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
