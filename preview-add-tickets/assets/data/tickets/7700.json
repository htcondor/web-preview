{"id": 7700, "title": "Ticket #7700: NETWORK_INTERFACE=* should choose reverse DNS", "description": "<blockquote>\nA user contacted us to report problems is their dual-NIC machines left NETWORK_INTERFACES set to its default value of '*'.  Their machines have interfaces bond0, bond1, and lo0, where bond0 and bond1 are both private network addresses.  Between two private network addresses, HTCondor always chooses the first one listed.  This caused problems for match password authentication, where the starter and the shadow were communicating over the second NIC; it's not clear why.\n\n<p>While in general we can't choose between private addresses, in this case, the machines' names resolve to the bond1, and this problem could have been avoided.\n\n</p><p>This heuristic should probably only be used to break ties.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Jun-24 07:07", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Jun-22 09:09", "fixed_version": "2020-Jun-22 09:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
