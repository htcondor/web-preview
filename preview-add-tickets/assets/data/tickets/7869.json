{"id": 7869, "title": "Ticket #7869: Debian and Ubuntu should have distinct version numbers across distros", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe Debian and Ubuntu packages should have unique version numbers across distros within a single build. Then we can follow Debian and Ubuntu standard practices and have packages for all the distros in a single repository. Also, htcondor would get updated when doing a version updated</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Oct-13 10:30:12 by matyas:</em> <br/>\n\nIt feels like there are multiple changes in this commit -- what's the difference between a 'full' build and a 'binary' build, why you're using dch for one but not the other, etc.  Could you explain?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Oct-19 08:27:15 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nSo, Debian and Ubuntu have all versions in a repository. So, the version number must be different between stretch and buster and xenial, bionic, and focal. The convention is to add a +b1, +b2 to binary rebuilds and to increment the release modifier 8.8.11-1.1, 8.8.11-1.2 for rebuilds which include Debian source package changes.\n\n<p>So, for the code, the dch in the block of code before the changes sets the base changelog entry for the build. If you are just doing a binary rebuild with no changes to Debian spec files, you use dch to bump the version in the changelog. If there are spec file changes, then you have to do a build including the sources.\n\n</p><p>So, a binary build just produces the binary packages. No source packages are produced, because they are already available.\n\n</p><p>A full build creates binary and source packages.\n\n</p><p>Every build uses dch to set the changelog. However, dch is used to bump the version number when neeeded.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Oct-19 13:04:38 by matyas:</em> <br/>\n\nMakes sense. OK, looks good.
