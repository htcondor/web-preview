The interface should be generic enough to field queries for fields and ads not currently supported, in support of work on <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"tktview?tn=594\" title=\"CondorView collector should track arbitrary fields\">#594</a></span>.  The planned immediate user is <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"tktview?tn=597\" title=\"New CondorView user interface\">#597</a></span>.\n\n<p>This interface should also be able to report a \"recommended graph type\" for a given field.  Perhaps \"Type: line|bar|area\" and \"stacked|not-stacked\" as an option.
