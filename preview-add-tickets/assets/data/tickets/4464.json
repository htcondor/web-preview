This problem can affect all Condor binaries if GLOBUS_THREAD_MODEL is set in the environment.\n\n<p>Whenever we're activating Globus modules, we should first explicitly set the Globus thread model we want. At the moment, we want \"none\". In the future, if we want a different threading model, we can imply the fix from <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=4440\" title=\"cream_gahp fails at startup due to lt_dlopen() search path\">#4440</a></span> for the library loading problem.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Aug-07 11:43:29 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong> by zmiller:  Looks good.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Jul-16 14:39</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=40686\">[40686]</a></span>: Enforce Globus thread model \"none\". <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=4464\" title=\"Setting GLOBUS_THREAD_MODEL causes GSI failures\">#4464</a></span> If the Globus thread model is not \"none\", then Globus will use lt_dlopen() to load a Globus library with routines for the given thread library.
