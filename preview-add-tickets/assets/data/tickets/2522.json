Index entries will also help manual readers.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Oct-04 15:39:55 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nIMHO, adding a whole entry/terminology in the manual about the accountant is probably not worth the space.  Instead, I suggest that wherever we say 'the accountant', we instead simply say something like 'the user accounting mechanism in the condor_negotiator'.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Oct-04 16:03:49 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nWhen I talked to Greg T. about that very idea, which is what has been implemented so far (change references to \"the accountant\" to not use that term), he was of the opposite opinion.  Thus, this ticket was born.  If we want to not use \"the accountant\" in the manual, we should make sure that all our developers know this, reducing the number of times that I have to change it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Oct-19 11:15:18 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nAs this ticket is resolved, we will keep \"the accountant\" out of the manual, and instead substitute a phrase, such as the one suggested by Todd.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Oct-31 12:07</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=28058\">[28058]</a></span>: We're not using \"the Accountant\" in our descriptions.
