{"id": 5431, "title": "Ticket #5431: shared port should fail when source and destination are the same", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn order to avoid a deadlock on windows when the collector tries to update it ad to itself, the shared port daemon should quickly refuse to allow a daemon to open a socket to itself using the shared port as intermediary.\n\n<p>This will turn a hang and failure into a simple failure.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Dec-04 13:42:53 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nI have patch that should work if a daemon specifically requests itself, but that doesn't seem to actually happen.  Instead, the collector tries to connect to itself by connecting without specifying a shared port at all; when it does so, since it doesn't (and can't) send its own ID along, the shared port daemon has no way to tell what's going on.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Dec-10 17:48:34 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>The code looks good, but I'm not sure about the cost of checking every forwarding request.  I hate to add knobs, but maybe this a good place to add one with a comment in the param table that it's a potential scalability thing?  I don't know.  I'm also always leery of omitting safety.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Dec-14 21:58</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=46586\">[46586]</a></span>: Version history for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5283\" title=\"Shared port deadlock on Windows?\">#5283</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5430\" title=\"deadlock on windows when daemon talks to itself via shared port\">#5430</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5431\" title=\"shared port should fail when source and destination are the same\">#5431</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5432\" title=\"collector doesn't always remove itself from collector list\">#5432</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5433\" title=\"shared port on windows should hand sockets off without taking bigmutex\">#5433</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5434\" title=\"Overflow error when setting cgroup vm limit when VM &gt; 2 gb\">#5434</a></span>  (By Tim Theisen )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Dec-05 21:44</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=46358\">[46358]</a></span>: for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=5431\" title=\"shared port should fail when source and destination are the same\">#5431</a></span>, shared port server will refuse to connect when source and destination are the same. ===VersionHistory:Pending===  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Dec-14 16:57", "status": "resolved", "created": "2015-Dec-04 11:15", "fixed_version": "2015-Dec-04 11:15", "broken_version": "", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "DaemonSharedP", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#5430", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
