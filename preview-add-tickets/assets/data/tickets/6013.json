{"id": 6013, "title": "Ticket #6013: Collect JVM statistics for Java Universe jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom Michael Pelletier:\n\n<p>We ran into a situation here where jobs were choking out because their heap space was too small, which was driving their garbage collectors to extremes, and it occurred to me that it would be handy if the Java universe used \"jstat\" or something like that to collect useful statistics about the operation of the JVM during the run. I'm not familiar enough with Java to know everything that might be useful, but at least in this case knowing things like the number of GC events and GC time would have been helpful. In addition, the min, max, and current heap sizes could be placed in immutable job attributes. This would increase the usefulness of the Java universe, I suspect.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Nov-14 16:16", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Nov-14 16:15", "fixed_version": "2016-Nov-14 16:15", "broken_version": "v080508", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "s8756", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
