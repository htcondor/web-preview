{"id": 1839, "title": "Ticket #1839: check ownership of files in condor tarballs", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere should be a test that confirms that all entries in the tar package are owned by root.  In 7.5.5, we had packages where files were owned by the slot user id on the NMI build machine that generated by the package.  This is a security concern if the tar is unpacked by root.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:20:02 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-25 10:02:40 by kronenfe:</em> <br/>\n\nBack in Feb/Mar I added an ownership check in the file at:\nnmi_tools/glue/build/check-tarball.pl\n\n<p>I just found this ticket so I didn't associate my commits with it.
