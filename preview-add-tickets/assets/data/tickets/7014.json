{"id": 7014, "title": "Ticket #7014: Vanila universe checkpoint on eviction by default", "description": "<blockquote>\nVanilla Universe checking pointing for job eviction should be enabled by default and leave it to users to opt out if so desired.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\nOur proposal is to (a) make vanilla universe check pointing first-class in the submit language and (b) simplify the interface.  Specifically, all the user will have to set is <code>CheckpointExitCode</code> (name subject to change); HTCondor will take care of the details.  This will <em>not</em> by default set <code>when_to_transfer_files</code> to <code>ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT</code>; the vanilla universe check pointing implementation will be changed so that this is not necessary.  If we did make transferring the checkpoint on eviction the default, then the default would be to require checkpoint updates to be atomic, which seems like a good way to cause problems.\n\n<p>Implementation-wise, we presently anticipate the following:\n</p><ul>\n<li>changing the submit utils to transform <code>CheckpointExitCode</code> into <code>SuccessCheckpointExitCode</code> and <code>WantFTOnCheckpoint</code>;\n</li><li>changing the starter so that <code>WantFTOnCheckpoint</code> being set will force intermediate file transfer regardless of the setting of <code>when_to_transfer_files</code>;\n</li><li>(optionally) changing the starter so that the presence of <code>SuccessCheckpointExitCode</code> implies <code>WantFTOnCheckpoint</code>;\n</li><li>changing the startd to advertise the ability to transfer files on checkpoint, and changing submit utils to add that requirement to the job.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>See <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7031\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7031'); return false;\" title=\"Make CheckpointExitCode a first-class submit command.\">#7031</a></span>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Apr-24 13:48:47 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nI think this means, specifically, that setting <code>CheckpointSig</code> does not set or override <code>KillSig</code>.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Apr-24 13:51:45 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nOnce we actually remove standard universe for good, we can switch 'ckpt or syscalls' to 'checkpointing' (and short name to 'ckpt', not 'std').

Why make the user set both?
