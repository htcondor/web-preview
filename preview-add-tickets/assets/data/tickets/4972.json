{"id": 4972, "title": "Ticket #4972: Support non-periodic application-level checkpoints in vanilla universe", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs long as we're allowing the user to specify a particular termination condition (signal or exit code) to signal a successful checkpoint, why not transfer the sandbox whenever the application exits that way (if it asks)?  This would allow applications which checkpoint based on events (e.g., finished an iteration of the computation) to give themselves the best possible chance of preserving their work (because it would no longer depend on being evicted with a long-enough grace period).\n\n<p>Will need to implement throttling, for obvious reasons.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Aug-26 13:43:08 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nNote that we'd like to make this work without requiring ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT -- if the job is configured without periodic checkpoints, it likely can't take one on eviction, and its state may not be consistent at that time.

Being able to detect that they're doing that -- and more generally, monitoring -- is more important.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Sep-18 14:40:07 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nMarking a three-year-old \"defer\" ticket abandoned.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Aug-27 15:46</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=45750\">[45750]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4972\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4972'); return false;\" title=\"Support non-periodic application-level checkpoints in vanilla universe\">#4972</a></span>) Put jobs which fail when sent their checkpoint signal on hold.
