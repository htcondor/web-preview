{"id": 471, "title": "Ticket #471: \"Report Node\" idea for Dagman", "description": "<blockquote>\nSome of our big users have dags which have many nodes in them, but can collectively generate reports every N nodes of completion. It would be nice if there was a node which could be started up on certain conditions like \"after N category X nodes complete\" or \"after N hours\" and run a scheduler universe job which can do something on behalf of the submitter--such as collecting the various parital solutions and generating a report. These \"report nodes\" wouldn't be considered part of the nodes which must be complete for the whole dag to complete, but would be considered nodes that when running, account for the dag being in the running state. These report nodes may have crondor-like behavior, but also may not.\n\n<p>This type of node is not currently representable in the dag structure and exists outside of the representable set of node types and features.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:21", "status": "new", "created": "2009-May-11 10:00", "fixed_version": "2009-May-11 10:00", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu, wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
