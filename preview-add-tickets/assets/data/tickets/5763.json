(Part of the reason that this occurred to me is that there's not really a good place to mention that the condor_c-gahp now logs TCP file transfer stats by default.)\n\n<p>Anyhow, I'm thinking that there should be a general logging section that tells you what to expect to see in $(LOG), what the meanings of the different files are, where to change what's in them, etc.\n\n</p><p>Right now about the only part of the manual that seems to refer to this is the config knob section, but it doesn't really tie things together.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2017-Jun-01 14:35", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jun-29 11:02", "fixed_version": "2016-Jun-29 11:02", "broken_version": "v080408", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5663", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
