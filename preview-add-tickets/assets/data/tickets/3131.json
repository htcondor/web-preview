For each hostname, it should do a forward lookup, and discard any entry in the list where a forward lookup does not return the same address.\n\n</p><p>This should be a simple patch, but things are more complicated now with the IPv6 code. With the addition of IPv6, it is not clear the host alias functionality is intact, and also not clear that all code paths funnel through <code>condor_gethostbyaddr()</code> anymore like they did before IPv6.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jul-18 11:56:33 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nThoughts on a workaround:\n\n<p>Until folks upgrade their binaries, I folks would be safe if they changed their host allow/deny settings to only reference IP addresses (no hostnames).
