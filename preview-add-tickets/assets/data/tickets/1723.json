{"id": 1723, "title": "Ticket #1723: make nightly NMI submit script submit Condor to build on EVERYTHING", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen the nightly script runs, it should not only submit the official ports and the nmi \"one off' ports of the official branches, but also a build of Condor to every other machine not in the union of the previous two sets. These builds will be very clipped and will likely require some porting work to make good enough to build a hyper clipped condor.\n\n<p>NMI requires this so they always have a build of Condor for every platform.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Feb-28 11:07:32 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI worked on this over time, what I've implemented is good enough.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-28 11:07", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Oct-20 10:39", "fixed_version": "2010-Oct-20 10:39", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Port", "assigned_to": "psilord", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": "20101022"}
