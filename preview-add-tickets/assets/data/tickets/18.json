The issue may have had something to do with machines sending ads to the Collector before getting their hostnames changed from the one in their common Windows install image to something unique. They may have worked around the problem by avoiding that from happening.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-17 15:08:25 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nNote the collector is on Linux, and now they sent in a core file via RUST.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-23 11:14:16 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nGreg is handing this ticket off to me.\n\n<p>2011-04-29.  Haven't heard back from Clemson on this for a LONG time.  I'm going to resolve the ticket.  I can re-open it if needs be.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2011-Apr-29 12:37", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jan-15 09:47", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-15 09:47", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "nleroy", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "a18912", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
