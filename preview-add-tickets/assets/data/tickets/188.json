{"id": 188, "title": "Ticket #188: Eliminate CONDOR_EXT CONDOR_TST_CNFDTL and CONDOR_TST_LRG repositories", "description": "<blockquote>\nHandling several repositories for Condor is a pain. When possible, we want to reduce the number of repositories we have to manage. Three of our current five repos (CONDOR_EXT, CONDOR_TST_CNFDTL and CONDOR_TST_LRG) hold large tarballs that don't change and which we don't want to pollute the CONDOR_SRC repo. Almost all of these tarballs come from external groups.\n\n<p>A better solution is to host these static tarballs on a web server and retrieve them as needed during the build. The small ancillary files that we maintain in these repos will be moved into CONDOR_SRC.\n\n</p><p>This will dramatically shrink the amount of code in the Condor source tarball, both in NMI and for our users.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Feb-05 16:19:17 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nEverything is almost ready to go. I will meet with Nick tomorrow to set up automatic backups and replication of the externals on the web server. Then, once the dust settles from 7.3.0, I'll resync the set of active externals and merge the changes into V7_2-branch and master.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:16", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Feb-05 13:57", "fixed_version": "2009-Feb-05 13:57", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
