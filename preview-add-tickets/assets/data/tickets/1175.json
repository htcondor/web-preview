{"id": 1175, "title": "Ticket #1175: Good error messages for invalid configuration settings", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen faced with an invalid configuration setting, Condor usually blunders along with some sort of guess. Exactly how it blunders along varies from setting to setting.  This can surprise users.  For example condor-admin 20228 discovered that \"vm_networking=nat\" is silently identical to \"vm_networking=false\".  They spent some time diagnosing the problem.  Better behavior would be to either emit a warning to the log, possibly followed by EXCEPTing.  EXCEPTing increases the chances that the administrator will notice and fix the bad setting, but if we can't detect the problem until runtime, I expect users will be angry if a daemon runs for several days before needing to consider a setting, then trips over the landmine.\n\n<p>A solution might be related to the grand unified param() system (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"tktview?tn=123\" title=\"Grand unified param() system: Phase 1\">#123</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"stalled\" href=\"tktview?tn=988\" title=\"Grand unified param() system: Phase 2\">#988</a></span>).  Perhaps, at least for some settings, it could know the range of allowed values.  \"vm_networking is boolean\", \"num_cpus is a positive, non-zero integer\", etc.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 14:53", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Feb-03 13:50", "fixed_version": "2010-Feb-03 13:50", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#988", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "a20228", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
