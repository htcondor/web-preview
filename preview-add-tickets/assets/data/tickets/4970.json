We need to be able to use other checkpoint servers.  We would probably like an adapter to use the existing standard universe checkpoint server, since that's already deployed as LIGO infrastructure, but it would be OK to start with something like the transferd, instead.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "experimental", "last_change": "2016-Feb-16 14:49", "status": "defer", "created": "2015-Apr-01 13:16", "fixed_version": "2015-Apr-01 13:16", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#4968", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, downes@uwm.edu ,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
