{"id": 824, "title": "Ticket #824: schedd ad does not contain TotalLocalRunningJobs etc.", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe published schedd ad does not contain <code>TotalLocalRunningJobs</code> and <code>TotalSchedulerRunningJobs</code>, which are proposed to be referenced in the new default schedd \"start\" expressions for 7.4.  These attributes are inserted into a private copy of the ad that is used to evaluate schedd \"start\" expressions, so the expressions will work, but since the attributes are not in the published schedd ad, -analyze (which is now smart enough to evalute the schedd \"start\" expressions) will not be able to give sensible advice about why local and scheduler jobs are idle.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Oct-07 17:32:50 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI committed a fix for 7.4 that fixes this.  However, the deeper puzzle remains: why does the schedd maintain two copies of the code that creates the schedd ad: one for the published ad and one for the ad that is used to evaluate start expressions?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Mar-09 18:09:41 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nNote:  this ticket is marked as done in 7.4.0, and there's a corresponding version history entry.
