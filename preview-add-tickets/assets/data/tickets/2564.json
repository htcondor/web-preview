Your patch improves the situation by making the sleep configurable.  Of course, the underlying race condition remains.\n\n</p><p>I think we should go ahead and add your new configuration variable.  However, we should also fix the race condition.

After sleep expiration, it was presumed that the hibernation process was not successful and therefore all resource was re-enabled and collector updated. But hibernation was successful only last longer.\n\n<p>This patch add configuration variable HIBERNATION_WAIT_INTERVAL to override default value.
