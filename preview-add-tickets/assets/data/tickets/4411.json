{"id": 4411, "title": "Ticket #4411: condor_advertise -multi should block until the collector has added all", "description": "<blockquote>\n<code>condor_advertise -multi</code>  can send multiple ads to the collector in a relatively short amount of time, but those ads will actually be processed by the collector one at a time while doing other work in between each ad.  So on a busy collector this can take a <strong>long</strong> time for the ads to show up.  We have seen 291 ads take more than 10 minutes to be read by the collector out of the message stream.\n\n<p>It would be better feedback to the user if condor_advertise could be told to wait until the collector had read the ads before returning.  Because the behavior of not waiting is long-standing.  We will make this an opt-in behavior via a new command line argument <code>-wait</code>. <code>-wait</code> will imply <code>-tcp</code> since that is required to make this feature work without changing the collector.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Nov-12 14:52", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Jun-23 11:02", "fixed_version": "2014-Jun-23 11:02", "broken_version": "v080200", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "s8446", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
