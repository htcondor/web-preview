{"id": 4602, "title": "Ticket #4602: Clean up DAGMan VARS parsing", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere's some code in parse.cpp that allows a line with VARS definitions to come before the corresponding JOB, DATA, or SUBDAG EXTERNAL line.\n\n<p>There are a bunch of things I don't like about this:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>The implementation is kind of weird -- it immediately tries to assign the value to a node, and if the node doesn't exist it sticks the VARS line into a special list to re-try after all the rest of the parsing is done.  If we're going to have this capability, why not just stuff all VARS lines into the list immediately, so we don't have two cases?\n\n<p></p></li><li>There isn't any comment in the code explaining what's going on (I'm going to change this soon).\n\n<p></p></li><li>I can't find any reference at all to this change in the version history or any gittrac ticket, so I don't know what the rationale for it was or when it was made.\n\n<p></p></li><li>I'm tempted to remove this code entirely, because I don't see a compelling reason for it, and I don't like that VARS is unlike every other command in this respect.\n\n<p></p></li><li>There doesn't seem to be a test for this functionality.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Aug-04 17:08:35 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- just disabling the varg stuff in parse_vars() breaks gittrac #1780/\njob_dagman_splice-R.
