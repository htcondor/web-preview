{"id": 2408, "title": "Ticket #2408: Identify test problems in new batlab", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe hourly builds are running in batlab, but the tests are hosed.  Half the tests fail, and all of the tests take substantially longer than in the new batlab.  The guess is the new metronome which runs all tests in a separate personal condor job prevents state from leaking from one test to another.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nThere were several problems with the tests in new batlab, related to the running each test in a new personal condor.  Detecting that the personal condor was/wasn't running was broken, starting a new personal condor was broken, etc.\n\n<p>This has all been fixed, and at least two of the platforms in new batlab are running and passing almost all of the tests.\n\n</p><p>Rhel6 is still missing some standard-uni related prereqs, and the mechanism to rsync the names of the nightly build tags to the new batlab needs to be changed, but other than that, we are making good progress.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Sep-12 13:38:58 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nAll rhel6 prereqs have been found and installed.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2011-Sep-12 13:39", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Aug-22 15:48", "fixed_version": "2011-Aug-22 15:48", "broken_version": "v070101", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "#2391", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": "20110829"}
