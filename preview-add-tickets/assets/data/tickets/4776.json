Correspondingly, the starter will kill the job - but nothing is logged in the user log.\n\n</p><p>This resulted in a user seeing two execute events in a row.\n\n</p><p>(we verified that increasing the lease duration fixed this, but I didn't verify the diagnosis above is correct).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2014-Dec-15 14:39", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Dec-15 14:39", "fixed_version": "2014-Dec-15 14:39", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
