{"id": 2940, "title": "Ticket #2940: [Debian] Scripts with language extensions in sbin", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe Debian packaging rules forbid filename extensions indicating a specific scripting language for binaries in the system PATH. In Condor, condor_vm_vmware.pl and grid_monitor.sh run afoul of this. The proposed solution is to rename them. But since their locations are set in the Condor config file, we will need to have symlinks for the old names to avoid breaking installations that are upgrading from older versions. The Debian package will need a patch that omits the symlinks.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Apr-11 14:16:19 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nYou can rename on install target based on platform with CMAKE.  It seems silly to go the other route.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-11 14:16:55 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nIn fact for windows you need the extension .pl...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-11 14:27:12 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nDo we need the <code>.pl</code> on Windows? We're invoking the perl interpreter explicitly and specifying the path to the vmware perl script as a command-line argument.\n\n<p>The filenames are also recorded in the config file and the param table. I don't like the idea of those values being different based on linux flavor and how Condor is built.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-11 14:34:15 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nAnother alternative is to move those two scripts into libexec. They're not meant to be run by a user or admin.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-11 14:37:00 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\n+1 to the last option.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Apr-12 13:09</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=31670\">[31670]</a></span>: minor editing of version history item ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2940\" title=\"[Debian] Scripts with language extensions in sbin\">#2940</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Apr-11 15:24</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=31634\">[31634]</a></span>: Rename condor_vm_vmware.pl source file to condor_vm_vmware. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2940\" title=\"[Debian] Scripts with language extensions in sbin\">#2940</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Apr-11 13:39</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=31627\">[31627]</a></span>: Remove file extensions from condor_vm_vmware.pl and grid_monitor.sh <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=2940\" title=\"[Debian] Scripts with language extensions in sbin\">#2940</a></span> Debian packaging rules forbid filename extensions that indicate a specific scripting langauge on binaries that reside in the system PATH.
