{"id": 287, "title": "Ticket #287: collector not binding to dynamic port in windows tests", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe 7.3 (i.e. trunk) tests on windows in NMI are having the collector bind to 9618 in all personal condor's other than the main one started by the test.  This is not happening in 7.2.\n\n<p>This likely has something to do with how we compare addresses.  We search for our host in COLLECTOR_HOST and apparently this is not finding a match.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Apr-03 16:17:52 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nThis ticket appears to be a repeat of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=288\" title=\"Port collision not noticed by condor daemons in windows\">#288</a></span>.
