This incurs a great deal of unnecessary overhead, particularly on the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=OpenStack\" title=\"Open Stack\">OpenStack</a></span> controller.  HTCondor would be a better and more efficient netizen if it included the owner-ID filter.\n\n<p>This owner-ID has nothing do with the HTCondor concept of a job's 'owner', and may require the submitter to include more information -- the access key ID is not the owner ID.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jun-06 16:18:07 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is a low priority for Tony Tiradani at the moment because, in his configuration, all VMs are started by the same user.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jun-06 16:18", "status": "new", "created": "2013-May-28 11:25", "fixed_version": "2013-May-28 11:25", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "fermi", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
