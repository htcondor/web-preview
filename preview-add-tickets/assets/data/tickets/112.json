{"id": 112, "title": "Ticket #112: In OSG ProcD, procd_ctl LIST broken for subfamilies", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe OSG ProcD allows a list of processes it is tracking to be displayed along with some resource usage information via the procd_ctl LIST command. This command's syntax also allows a PID to be given in order to restrict the listing to a sub-family. This feature is broken, however; the listing will always include all processes being tracked by the ProcD.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Feb-24 13:46:45 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is now fixed.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:15", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jan-26 10:02", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-26 10:02", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "psilord", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
