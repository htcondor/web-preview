{"id": 6745, "title": "Ticket #6745: Fix voms when using libressl", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen moving to use LibreSSL on the latest version of macOS (10.13), we left the voms library with an unresolved reference to ASN1_sign(). This function is present in OpenSSL, but was removed from LibreSSL. This was ok for normal HTCondor binaries, as they never use voms in a way that would call that function. But we get a runtime error about the unresolved symbol in the python bindings.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Aug-23 16:34:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nSince we build our releases on older versions of macOS, which don't have LibreSSL, this change doesn't merit a version history entry.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Aug-23 12:52</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=55334\">[55334]</a></span>: Don't call ASN1_sign() in voms when using LibreSSL. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6745\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6745'); return false;\" title=\"Fix voms when using libressl\">#6745</a></span> LibreSSL removed the ASN1_sign() function of OpenSSL.
