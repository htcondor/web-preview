{"id": 2516, "title": "Ticket #2516: Add bandwidth/connection limits controls on submit side", "description": "<blockquote>\nSubmit points are frequently constrained by bandwidth.  This may lead to claiming a bunch of machines, then spending long periods dribbling data out to them.  Furthermore, a lot of machines pulling at the same time, can crush the poor submit point, leaving it unresponsive.  We've seen both behaviors on the primary submit point for CHTC.  Condor should be more intelligent.  Users should not have to modify their jobs to avoid rendering their submit point unresponsive.\n\n<p>Step 1 is figuring out the right solution.  Random thoughts:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Limit the number of concurrent file transfers.  New file transfers would block upon hitting the limit.\n</li><li>Limit the bandwidth being used, blocking new transfers until bandwidth is free.\n</li><li>Limit the number of jobs starting; if too much file transfer (bandwidth or number) is occurring refuse more matches.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Sep-30 13:50", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Sep-30 13:50", "fixed_version": "2011-Sep-30 13:50", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
