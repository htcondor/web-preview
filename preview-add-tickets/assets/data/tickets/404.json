{"id": 404, "title": "Ticket #404: Admin configurable condor_submit defaults", "description": "<blockquote>\n(Suggestion originally from Stephen Boyack of IDA-CCR)\n\n<p>It would be nice if the administrator could change the defaults condor_submit uses.  For example, on Linux they could specify \"SUBMIT_DEFAULT_UNIVERSE=vanilla\" if he knows his users overwhelmingly use the vanilla universe.  Or he might specify \"SUBMIT_DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION=NEVER\" if he knows his users submit monstrous numbers of simultaneous jobs.  Both of these are real examples, and the default notification actually caused problems when a new user with hundreds of thousands of sub-minute jobs was crushed with email from Condor.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Apr-22 14:27:51 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>echo -e \"executable=/bin/true\\nnotification=always\\nqueue\\n\" | env _CONDOR_Notification=Never _CONDOR_SUBMIT_EXPRS=Notification condor_submit -verbose -dump /dev/null | grep ^Notification\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Now if only you could make SUBMIT_EXPRS second class...\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jun-07 14:47:18 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nSUBMIT_EXPRS mostly works to implement defaults today.  How the administrator specifies them isn't necessarily obvious and disagrees with the manual, see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1429\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1429'); return false;\" title=\"SUBMIT_EXPRS docs vs code: Not like +syntax.\">#1429</a></span> for details.  That SUBMIT_EXPRS works as a default today may be a bug; either the code or the manual is wrong, see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1430\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1430'); return false;\" title=\"SUBMIT_EXPRS docs vs code disagree on overrides\">#1430</a></span> for details.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jun-07 14:51:58 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nI should note, at least one more external user wants to be able to set user-overriddable defaults, specifically to set notification=never to avoid drowning his email system because of a user mistake.  So the use for a setting to set defaults is clearly present.  In the meanwhile I told him to use SUBMIT_EXPRS, but I had to warn him that technically he's using it a outside of the documented behavior, and it thus may change in future releases.  That's not good.\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-May-31 17:09", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-22 10:38", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-22 10:38", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
