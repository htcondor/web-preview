There are at least two possible solutions.\n1) The daemon that starts the procd can create the pipes for it (similar to how the master works) and pass the pipes to the procd\n2) The daemon that starts the procd can wait until the procd is ready.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-May-31 17:16", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jan-17 12:10", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-17 12:10", "broken_version": "v070705", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "kronenfe", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "kronenfe@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
