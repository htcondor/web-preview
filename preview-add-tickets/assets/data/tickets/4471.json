{"id": 4471, "title": "Ticket #4471: Windows looses forward process on jobs with schedd turned off then on", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhile exploring schedd restart tests and this rust, I encountered misbehaviour\non windows with a schedd off/ schedd on scenario. On linux if you have running jobs and you turn off the schedd and turn it back on, you see a disconnect, a reconnect and then you see the jobs complete. On windows you see an eviction, a failed reconnect and then rescheduled jobs. The behaviour should be the same.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nWe will have to see these tests after windows reconnects work.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2014-Aug-14 12:15", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Jul-18 12:06", "fixed_version": "2014-Jul-18 12:06", "broken_version": "v080203", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bt", "rust": "a8455", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
