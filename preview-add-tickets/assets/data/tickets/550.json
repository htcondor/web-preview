In order to have this apply to condor daemons, we could either pam-enable condor, or run condor under a pam-enabled wrapper.  The former is a bit scary, as it requires condor to dynamically link to libpam.so, which isn't available as a .a.  So, we've recommended to start condor under su (which is pam-enabled)\n\n<p>e.g.\n\n</p><p>/bin/su root -c \"condor_master\"\n\n</p><p>This was acceptable.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2009-Dec-23 12:06", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jun-09 11:53", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-09 11:53", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "#546", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
