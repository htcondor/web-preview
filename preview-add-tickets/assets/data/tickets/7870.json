{"id": 7870, "title": "Ticket #7870: Read IDTOKENS files for daemons as root, not condor", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe files containing daemon credentials are currently expected to be owned by the canonical 'condor' user in /etc/condor.  This ticket proposes changing them to be owned by root.\n\n<p>One advantage of having them owned by <code>condor</code> is that the admin is probably logged in as the <code>condor</code> user when if running <code>condor_token_create</code> and so it's natural to create a file as that same user.\n\n</p><p>However, in almost all other cases (KERBEROS, GSI, SSL, MUNGE, and even PASSWORD) the daemon credentials are owned by root and not readable by the <code>condor</code> user.  For security and consistency I think IDTOKENS should be the same.  If the admin is relying on HTCondor's \"bootstrap\" mode to have daemons auto-generate token requests and then store the tokens, this can be done as root as well, so I don't believe the burden on the administrator is a problem.\n\n</p><p>If there are other pros and cons please add them to this description.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 11:38", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Oct-01 11:01", "fixed_version": "2020-Oct-01 11:01", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "#7767", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, bbockelman@morgridge.org", "due_date": ""}
