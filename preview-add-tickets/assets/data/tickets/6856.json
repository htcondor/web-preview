{"id": 6856, "title": "Ticket #6856: JobRouter sets the user attribute in the routed job", "description": "<blockquote>\nFarrukh at FNAL noticed that jobs coming through their CE from the same user would sometimes result in the local batch system accounting for the user under the CE <code>UID_DOMAIN</code> (e.g., fkhan@users.opensciencegrid.org) and sometimes under the local batch system <code>UID_DOMAIN</code> (e.g., fkhan@fnal.gov). This is due to the fact that the job router passes along the <code>user</code> attribute to the routed job, which in some cases the batch system schedd fixes to its <code>UID_DOMAIN</code>.\n\n<p>When submitting via Condor-C, the <code>user</code> attribute is removed so the receiving schedd can set it appropriately. We would like the job router to behave the same way.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Jan-18 14:33:38 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>Looks good to me.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6933\" title=\"Duplicate accounting entries for jobs submitted through the job router\">#6933</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nDuplicate accounting entries for jobs submitted through the job router</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Feb-06 14:58</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=56135\">[56135]</a></span>: Docs for job router User attribute bug fix. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6856\" title=\"JobRouter sets the user attribute in the routed job\">#6856</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Jan-16 14:54</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=56002\">[56002]</a></span>: Job Router shouldn't set User attribute in routed job. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6856\" title=\"JobRouter sets the user attribute in the routed job\">#6856</a></span> When the Job Router is routing between two schedds, they may have different values for UID_DOMAIN, meaning that the User attribute will be different.
