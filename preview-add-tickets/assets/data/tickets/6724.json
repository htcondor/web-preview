{"id": 6724, "title": "Ticket #6724: condor_submit should determine spool files for late materialization", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, late materialization cannot be used when spooling input files because condor_submit never determines which files to spool, and thus never spools them.\n\n<p>Currently condor_preen will delete spooled files for not-yet-materialized jobs.  Also, there is no way to share a spooled file between jobs, so even if all of the jobs use the same input, the file would have to be spooled multiple times.\n\n</p><p>We should probably fix the second problem before we add support for spooling to late-materialization.\n\n</p><p>Possible spooling issues:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>user disk quota\n</li><li>if there are shared input files, knowing NOT to update them when checkpointing.\n</li><li>if there are shared input files and a checkpoint, knowing to use the checkpoint file\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>We will most likely want to add to the cluster ad a special attribute that is the list of shared input files.  This will probably be something we figure out by looking at the submit rather than requiring the user to tell us.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 10:52", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Jul-31 16:05", "fixed_version": "2018-Jul-31 16:05", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#6166", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
