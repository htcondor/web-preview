(It also turns out they didn't know about the limit at all.)\n\n<p>Anyhow, they want to have a limit, but what they really want is to have separate limits for different users.  They obviously could do this by having separate schedds, but that seems like a lot of extra complexity to force users to deal with just to implement such limits.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Dec-09 11:32", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Dec-09 11:32", "fixed_version": "2014-Dec-09 11:32", "broken_version": "v080205", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
