{"id": 2617, "title": "Ticket #2617: Document USE_VISIBLE_DESKTOP for win7 etc.", "description": "<blockquote>\nre: condor_users\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">Part of the new Vista/Win7 security features is the prohibit services\nfrom sharing a desktop with users.   It is no longer possible on\nVista/Win7 to see the job's window on the same desktop as programs that\nwere started interactively.   Services now have their own desktop.\n\nSo to see the window from the Condor job, you have to configure\nVista/Win7 to detect interactive services, and then it will give you a\nway to switch desktops.    The instructions on how to enable interactive\nservices are here\nhttp://ben.versionzero.org/wiki/Condor_Enable_Visible_Desktop_on_Vista\n\nOnce you have done that, when a Condor job starts, Windows will pop up a\nmessage box asking if you want to switch to\nthe services desktop, where the Condor job's window is.\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nadded wiki page <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=UseVisibleDesktopVista\" title=\"Use Visible Desktop Vista\">UseVisibleDesktopVista</a></span>, which is a copy of Ben's page reformatted for our Wiki.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2012-May-30 17:44", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Nov-04 13:47", "fixed_version": "2011-Nov-04 13:47", "broken_version": "v070603", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tstclair", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
