We should review them on a case by case basis and decide.\n\n<p>Cause: khahn ran into problems with some misconfigured nodes that were configured to use a &lt;KEYWORD&gt;_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO hook, but the actual hook script was missing.  The startds would try to start jobs, but would EXCEPT.  khahn thinks it should have run the job anyway.  Generally speaking, that seems like the most convenient failure state, but is bad if the hooks are doing something Important: security, essential logging, setting up stuff a job requires. We should consider these and see if some should be changed to continue if the hook is missing.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Oct-15 13:12", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Oct-15 13:12", "fixed_version": "2012-Oct-15 13:12", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
