Proposed: delete the attribute, probably replace with D_FULLDEBUG?\n\n</p><p>D_PREEMPT appears to be completely unused.\n\n</p><p>D_NFS is solely used in condor_syscall_lib/extern_path.c.

Can it be D_FULLDEBUG?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Feb-01 10:37:25 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nD_KEYBOARD is useful because you'll get a ton of lines in the log every 5 seconds and eventually the whole log will be filled with that.
