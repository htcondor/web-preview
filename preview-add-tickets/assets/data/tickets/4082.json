The single quotes around the filename should be double quotes so interpolation works:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  open(OUT, '&gt;', \"$runningfile/$test\");\n</pre>\n\n<p>Clearly this is broken.  It looks like it's been broken since 2012-06-27.  Conclusion, no one cares.\n\n</p><p>Either fix it (per above).  Or perhaps tear it out as useless.  bt may have thoughts on the value of this feature.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Nov-18 17:10", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Nov-18 17:10", "fixed_version": "2013-Nov-18 17:10", "broken_version": "v080102", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
