{"id": 1410, "title": "Ticket #1410: Allow category throttling across splices", "description": "<blockquote>\nBill needs to have category throttles operate across splices for some of the work he's doing.  (In other words, he wants to be able to assign nodes in several different splices to the same category.)\n\n<p>My plan for doing this is to introduce a new convention that category names beginning with the colon character (':') will not be munged in the splice parsing code.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-May-19 10:45:47 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThe special character will be '+' instead of ':' -- I forgot that we were already using the '+' for renaming of splice nodes, etc.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-May-19 10:56:07 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nYeah, this is because : is a special file system character on macosx. The plus character, while ugly, is most portable. :(\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-May-20 10:21:42 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nIt seems to be working, so I'll resolve this ticket for you Kent.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-May-20 10:22:20 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nHrm, I won't resolve it, because you hadn't documented it. But I will make it active so you can finish the docs.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jun-18 17:04:16 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, I've finally documented the changes, so I'm going to resolve this ticket.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Jun-18 16:52</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=25536\">[25536]</a></span>: Gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1410\" title=\"Allow category throttling across splices\">#1410</a></span>: documented splice/category throttle changes.
