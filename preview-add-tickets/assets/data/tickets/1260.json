{"id": 1260, "title": "Ticket #1260: Privsep should look for permission and uid errors at condor startup.", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen using privsep there are a number of items that can be validated at startup or reconfig time.  This leads to a machine looking like condor is running happily until a job schedules.  It would be better to fail earlier so that a problem can be identified.  This is what a user probably expects.\n\n<p>For example, if SLOT12_EXECUTE is /home/slot5/execute, but /home/slot5/execute is not in valid-dirs in the privsep config, we know there will be an error at job run time. Condor should error out at this point and show that there is a configuration error. What happens, however, is that we don't get an error until a job runs. And condor will happily continue to match jobs and then reject them at run time.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Mar-04 13:43", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Mar-04 13:43", "fixed_version": "2010-Mar-04 13:43", "broken_version": "v070500", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "khahn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "khahn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
