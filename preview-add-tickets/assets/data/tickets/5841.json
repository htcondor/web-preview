{"id": 5841, "title": "Ticket #5841: Implement proxy delegation for HTCondor-CE-Bosco", "description": "<blockquote>\nHTCondor-CE-Bosco is an implementation of HTCondor-CE with JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES that use bosco as the grid_resource. We've noticed issues with proxy delegation: proxies on the CE are updated through the SPOOL directory but routed bosco jobs don't update their own copies of the proxies in the user's home directory.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Nov-16 15:39:15 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nThis could end up in the v8.7 series, so is the wisdom from the FW&lt;-&gt;OSG phone conf on 11/16/16\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Mar-22 15:33:47 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nDerek, are there any sites that could be candidates for testing Jaime's changes?
