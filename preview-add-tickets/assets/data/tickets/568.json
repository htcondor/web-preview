{"id": 568, "title": "Ticket #568: Condor on Windows Vista 7.2.1/7.2.3 is dead after power saving", "description": "<blockquote>\nAfter Vista is woken up from the power saved state Condor 7.2.1 and 7.2.3 are not re-starting correctly.  In this spesific case, the configuration file is kept on a network share, which is not accessible imediatly after the machine is woken because the machine's IP is dynamic, and it sometimes takes upwards of 2 minutes to get a new IP.  As a temporary solution, placing the configuration on the local disk seems to help the problem.\n\n<p>The greater issuue here is that Condor is epecting to be able to have network access imediatly once it is started, which may not always be the case.  Making Condor depend on various network service does not seem to aliviate the problem.  What Condor really needs is a way to detect if there is network connectivety.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jun-18 15:20:27 by burnett:</em> <br/>\n\nUser added a pause before the service was restarted, which got around the problem.  Another solution would have been to replace the master with a script that periodically checked for the configuration file.  Then, once it found it, it could launch the master.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 08:23", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jun-16 12:18", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-16 12:18", "broken_version": "v070200", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "burnett", "derived_from": "", "creator": "burnett", "rust": "a19373", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
