{"id": 5808, "title": "Ticket #5808: Be able to pass result from one DAG node to another", "description": "<blockquote>\nJust got a request today on htcondor-users to be able to pass the result from one node to another node:\n\n<p></p><pre>  JOB A foo.sub\n  SCRIPT POST A bar.sh $RETURN\n  JOB B bar.sub\n  VARS B=$(RETURN)\n</pre>\n\n<p>That syntax wouldn't quite work, but maybe something like this would:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  JOB A ...\n  JOB B ...\n  VARS B result=\"$RESULT(A)\"\n  SCRIPT PRE B my_script $RESULT(A)\n</pre>\n\n<p>Of course, this only works if job A has finished before job B runs.  I'm not sure if we should require that B is a \"descendant\" of A, or if it should just be a run-time error if we get to B and A hasn't finished...\n\n</p><p>Also, if node A fails, and B is a descendant of A, B will never get run.  So maybe this is only relevant if A has a POST script and we actually want the return value of A's HTCondor job, not node A as a whole.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jul-26 15:52", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jul-26 15:52", "fixed_version": "2016-Jul-26 15:52", "broken_version": "v080506", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, mike@talulat.com", "due_date": ""}
