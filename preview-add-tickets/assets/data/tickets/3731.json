Thus, the calls to MyString::sprintf(...) in dbms_urils.cpp cause a build failure. This happens only if you configure condor with \"WITH_POSTGRESQL=true\".</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nThe attached patch is incomplete (and is for condor 7.8.7). I went through the code again and found more places where the old and non-existent method is used. The attached new patch should be complete now.\n\n<p>Hm, seems I can neither delete the attachment nor upload a new one. I'll create a new ticket. -&gt; 4165</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"attach_get/772/dbms_utils.patch\">dbms_utils.patch</a>\n3469 bytes added by f.wolfheimer on 2013-Jul-01 19:46:54 UTC.\n<br/>\nThis patch file renames all calls to MyString::snprintf to MyString::formatstr(...).
