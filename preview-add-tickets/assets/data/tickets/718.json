Change the configuration file to turn it off (NET_REMAP_ENABLE=FALSE).  Restart a single daemon, say, \"condor_restart -schedd machinename\".  Observe either the schedd crashing, or hanging.\n\n<p>I expect to see a similar problem is I use SCHEDD.NET_REMAP_ENABLE=FALSE in the first place.\n\n</p><p>While mixing GCBized and non-GBCized daemons may be an unsupported configuration, it should not crash nor hang.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Nov-09 16:51:44 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nGCB is dead.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Nov-21 15:57", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Sep-04 13:26", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-04 13:26", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
