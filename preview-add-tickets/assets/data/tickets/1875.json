{"id": 1875, "title": "Ticket #1875: condor_master gets into busy-waiting state and starves jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhile trying to get 7.5.5. out the door, it was noticed that the windows build machine wasn't making progress on build jobs.  It turned out that the condor_master had gotten into a state where the main daemon-core loop was spinning without ever giving up the CPU.  The \"async_pipe\" was returning true from select(), but the daemon core main loop was never trying to read from the handle, so the state was never cleared.\n\n<p>Since the condor_master runs at higher priority than the jobs, all of the jobs were starving.\n\n</p><p>The daemon core loop handles the async_pipe differently between windows and unix - it appears that in windows if two or more signals came in in a short enough period of time, any windows daemon-core based daemon could be put into this busy-waiting state.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Feb-10 16:20</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=20374\">[20374]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=1875\" title=\"condor_master gets into busy-waiting state and starves jobs\">#1875</a></span>) fix for bug in windows code path of previous commit for this ticket. this fix uses the selector.fd_ready state rather than the async pipe as a trigger for emptying the pipe.
