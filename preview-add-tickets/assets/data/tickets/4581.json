{"id": 4581, "title": "Ticket #4581: Local hostname and IP address unrelated", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn init_local_hostname() in ipv6_hostname.cpp, the hostname and IP address selected to identify the local machine have no explicit relationship to each other. On a machine with multiple network interfaces, we can end up using the hostname of one interface and the IP address of another interface. In addition, setting NETWORK_INTERFACE only affects the IP address we use and setting NETWORK_HOSTNAME only affects the hostname we use.\n\n<p>In init_local_hostname(), it appears on casual inspection that we'll set the IP address based on the hostname, when we examine the records returned by ipv6_getaddrinfo(). But the IP address is always initialized earlier in the function, because we always have a value for NETWORK_INTERFACE (with '*' as a default).\n\n</p><p>We should do a better job of having the hostname and IP address we use correspond to the same network interface.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2014-Sep-08 15:43", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Sep-08 15:43", "fixed_version": "2014-Sep-08 15:43", "broken_version": "v080200", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
