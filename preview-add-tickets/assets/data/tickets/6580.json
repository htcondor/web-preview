The code does not report any error, it just never makes any progress.\n\n<p>Because of this, the async reader should default to synchronous reads on Windows, and there should be a knob to enable the async behavior for now. The knob will be called <code>ENABLE_ASYNC_LATE_MATERIALIZE_ITEM_DATA</code></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-May-04 11:43:33 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nno doc or version history for this knob at this time (possibly not ever)</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Feb-26 11:09</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=54358\">[54358]</a></span>: allow read of late materialize item data synchronously on Windows <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"tktview?tn=6580\" title=\"there should be a knob to turn off async reading of late mat item data\">#6580</a></span> we do this because OVERLAPPED reads are getting stuck on some machines and we don't know why. this commit adds a windows-specific knob to control whether item data is read sync or async the knob is ENABLE_ASYNC_LATE_MATERIALIZE_ITEM_DATA\u00a0[...]\n (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-May-04 11:43", "status": "resolved", "created": "2018-Feb-26 11:00", "fixed_version": "2018-Feb-26 11:00", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
