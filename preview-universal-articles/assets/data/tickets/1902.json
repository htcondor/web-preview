{"id": 1902, "title": "Ticket #1902: Sending reconfig signals to non-daemoncore daemons on windows fails", "description": "<blockquote>\nUsing condor_reconfig on windows results in signal 1 (SIGHUP) being sent to the daemons condor_master is managing.  This is only successful if the daemons are daemoncore daemons.  If there is a non-daemoncore daemon being managed by condor_master, then the signalling fails.  There should be some means to notify a non-daemoncore daemon to reconfigure.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-09 14:48", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Feb-07 11:17", "fixed_version": "2011-Feb-07 11:17", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "rrati", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
