Is there a race here, or are we guaranteed that it is hot by the time the starter's reaper is called?\n\n</p><p>Should we #ifdef LINUX the code in the reaper to do the event fd check?  It <em>should</em> be -1 on all other platforms, but...\n\n</p><p>Otherwise, looks good to merge to V8_2-branch\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Dec-16 21:00:40 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Greg,\n\n<p>I don't particularly like to do unnecessary ifdef's; we already rely on the fact that (m_oom_efd == -1) outside \"defined(HAVE_EVENTFD) &amp;&amp; defined(HAVE_EXT_LIBCGROUP)\".\n\n</p><p>Looking at the kernel code (well, the source tarball for 3.7.2 I happened to have on disk), the eventfd is always signaled before the OOM-killer routines run.  I'm no expert, but I believe this guarantees there's no race condition.\n\n</p><p>That said, what happens if the race is possible in some future Linux 4.0?  I would argue it's still OK; we already warn the user this race is possible in the starter log if disabling the OOM-killer failed.\n\n</p><p>Brian\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Dec-17 12:01:18 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nIf we feel good about the event being delivered before the signal, let's merge it to 8.2</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Dec-17 21:58</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/465c840790896f54b35c6e3015d1e56c759ccc45\">[41960]</a></span>: Ifdef out Get_Pipe_FD on Windows. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4774\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4774'); return false;\" title=\"OOM Management issues\">#4774</a></span>  (By Brian Bockelman )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Dec-17 20:13</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/3b5280f44c3ddcabc2ec0fc49615de6d0b307388\">[41957]</a></span>: Version history for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4774\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4774'); return false;\" title=\"OOM Management issues\">#4774</a></span>.
