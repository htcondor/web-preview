{"id": 4935, "title": "Ticket #4935: Our core file and error string detection was not working well", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe had a case where on a half a dozen platforms, the negotiator would drop a core on exit. There were a number of issues. One we were checking before we kill the personal HTCondor being used. Additionally if we had a test with multiple personal HTCoondors only a detection in the last one checked would triger an error. Quite a fee small changes to fix the timing and improve our detecting position.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Mar-13 08:35</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/eefcca855d0a767a389134ab3246c689fb34c763\">[43571]</a></span>: This is more working though cyqwin removal <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4862\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4862'); return false;\" title=\"de-cygwinize windows tests\">#4862</a></span> <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4935\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4935'); return false;\" title=\"Our core file and error string detection was not working well\">#4935</a></span> plus reworking the timings surrounding our core and ERROR detectiong code in the tests.
