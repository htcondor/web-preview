{"id": 5916, "title": "Ticket #5916: Warn when we encounter only invalid VOMS ACs", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen an invalid VOMS AC is encountered, it is silently ignored by the VOMS library.   This will occur either because it actually is invalid - or VOMS has not been configured correctly on this host), it is silently ignored.\n\n<p>While maliciously faked VOMS ACs are rare, this can be triggered by a common misconfiguration and cause HTCondor to behave in unexpected ways (i.e., mappings that are based on VOMS information will no longer match).\n\n</p><p>I propose that, whenever VOMS verification is enabled, we call <code>VOMS_Retrieve</code> twice: once with verification enabled and once without.  If we get zero attributes the first time and nonzero attributes the second time, we print out a loud warning message about failed verification.\n\n</p><p>If there are actually zero attributes at all (plain-old grid proxy), then we pay a minimal overhead: basically, the VOMS library will iterate through the list of attributes, see the lack of VOMS information, and return.\n\n</p><p>While this approach isn't perfect (it doesn't handle the cases where there are N attributes and only N-1 are invalid), it's probably going to catch almost all the errors - while minimizing the impact on valid proxies.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-May-31 14:33:52 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nApproach looks good to me.
