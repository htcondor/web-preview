{"id": 5669, "title": "Ticket #5669: Concurency limits ignored", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhile on site with a customer last week, I noticed that their concurrency limits were not being respected. We'd see messages in the negotiator log like:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">05/09/16 17:11:02 matchmakingAlgorithm: limit 6.000000 used 1.000000 pieLeft 5.000000\n05/09/16 17:11:02 Concurrency Limit: a1.fhjlsdahgjsadhgjksdhgjkashdkj is 1.000000 of max 1.000000\n05/09/16 17:11:02 Concurrency Limit a1.fhjlsdahgjsadhgjksdhgjkashdkj is 1.000000, requesting 1.000000, but cannot exceed 1.000000</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>but the negotiator would continue matching and jobs would execute in excess of the specified limit. Reverting from 8.4.3 to 8.4.0 fixed this issue. Unfortunately, I couldn't reproduce it this morning.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-May-09 16:17", "status": "new", "created": "2016-May-09 16:17", "fixed_version": "2016-May-09 16:17", "broken_version": "v080403", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bcotton", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
