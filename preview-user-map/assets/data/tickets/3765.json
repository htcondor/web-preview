{"id": 3765, "title": "Ticket #3765: cmd_drain issues", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe issue with this test was it was timing out after an hour. So far I have noted sevral things. The test was not explicit about all the things that it needed and on my test machine, it never got a collector or a negotiator so things just did not run. One of the tests used expected to see over 5 matches fail before deciding the job was not going to run(that is this checks purpose). But neither a short negotiation cycle was set nor a minimum number of slots desired for the test...... Now we'll see what is next.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jul-11 13:40</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/738e2f6f1c31ecdcec31d2bac85258889f2b753b\">[36861]</a></span>: Specifying daemons, slots and a short negotiator cycle seems to had it solid as a test now. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3765\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3765'); return false;\" title=\"cmd_drain issues\">#3765</a></span>  (By Bill Taylor )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Jun-02 16:16", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Jul-11 12:58", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-11 12:58", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#3741", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
