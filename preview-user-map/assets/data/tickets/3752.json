I took a look through the source and couldn't find anything obvious, so I'm pitching it over the wall to you guys:\n\n<p>Client report:\nWe had some jobs failing after upgrading to 7.8.8 because of the way the _CONDOR_SLOT sends back the variable.  In 7.6.x it sends back a number (1, 2, etc..).  In 7.8.8 it sends back a string (slot1, slot2, etc..).  Is this a bug in 7.8.8?  The manual for 7.8 says that it should be sending back a number.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jul-11 14:20:20 by bcotton:</em> <br/>\n\nOne additional change in behavior to note. In 7.8.8, a job running on a single-slot machine will have _CONDOR_SLOT empty, whereas in 7.6 it was still '1'.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2013-Jul-11 14:20", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jul-09 15:09", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-09 15:09", "broken_version": "v070808", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bcotton", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
