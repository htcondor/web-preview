{"id": 3727, "title": "Ticket #3727: basic test of STARTD_SLOT_ATTRS", "description": "<blockquote>\n<strong class=\"three\">Baisc test of STARTD_SLOT_ATTRS</strong>\n\n<p><strong>basic_startd_slot_attrs.run</strong>\n\n</p><p>This is a twofold test of STARD_SLOT_ATTRS. We first acquire some number of the slot names in the current personal htcondor which generate as a comma separated list. We also configure 4 slots with different memory amounts. The work horse function takes the slotX_xxxxxx and places them in a hash and increments the stored value for every entry. There should be the same number of entries as there are slots in the list if the ads are being published to every slot.. The first slot of the list has it's Memory value and slot name stored. From this we create the slotx_memory pattern. As we go through all the adds we ensure that every ad for memory for that slot matches what that slot had for Memory.\n\n</p><p>Either an incorrect slot ad count or a missed memory add amount will fail the test.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jun-27 17:14</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/ae70d819cabf6e45bc13719806c04a528c1e32ad\">[36707]</a></span>: Java soap test turned off till we can fix it but it is in the parent test ticket.
