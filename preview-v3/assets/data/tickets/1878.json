{"id": 1878, "title": "Ticket #1878: HEP jobs make CS desktops dependent on the HEP AFS cell", "description": "<blockquote>\nJoe Meehean just ran into a problem (and I think I ran into the same problem) where his desktop hung for several minutes because of AFS problems (see condor-admin #21589).  It turns out that the problem is this: CS machines have an AFS token on them that allows Condor jobs to access the HEP AFS cell.  Once a job has done this, the AFS cache on the machine contains files from HEP, even after the job is no longer running on the machine.  As long as those files are in the cache, the machine periodically needs to contact HEP, so if any kind of network problem happens, your machine hangs...\n\n<p>Joe pointed out that there is actually a more general problem that a Condor job could do something like download illegal music into /tmp or something like that...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2011-Jan-26 12:09", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Jan-26 12:09", "fixed_version": "2011-Jan-26 12:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "a21589", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, danb@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
