{"id": 4191, "title": "Ticket #4191: Abort DAG after a specified number of node failures", "description": "<blockquote>\nBrian Bockelman wants to be able to abort a DAG after a specified number of node failures, even if the DAG could make forward progress.\n\n<p>This should be pretty easy, since we already keep a running count of the number of failed nodes.  So we just have to add a knob for the user, and check that each time through the event/submission loop, I guess.\n\n</p><p>My initial thought is to have something like this:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  DAGMAN_MAX_NODE_FAILURES = 5\n</pre>\n\n<p>If we used that terminology, I think that a value of 0 would mean that the DAG would be aborted on the first node failure, and a negative value would disable this setting.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Jun-12 14:18:31 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nMaybe it would be better to have a macro like DAGMAN_ABORT_ON_FAILURE; then 0 would mean don't abort, 1 would mean abort on the first failure.\n\n<p>We'd also have to define whether a node that fails and then succeeds on a retry counts as a failure -- my initial thought is to say no.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-May-16 11:13", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Feb-04 10:34", "fixed_version": "2014-Feb-04 10:34", "broken_version": "v080103", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "#4198", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, bbockelm@cse.unl.edu,pfcouvar@syr.edu, coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
