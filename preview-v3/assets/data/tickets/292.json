{"id": 292, "title": "Ticket #292: Ensure ProcD named pipe uniqueness on Windows", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe ProcD uses named pipes for its communication. On Windows, named pipes do not exist in the file system namespace but rather have names of the form \\\\.\\pipe\\name. The default in Condor for Windows is to use the name \\\\.\\pipe\\procd_pipe. If two Condor instances attempt to run on the same machine without at least one of them overriding the default (using PROCD_ADDRESS), one of the two instances will fail. This is not a problem on UNIX because named pipes use file system names and we default to a path relative to $(LOCK), which must be different for different Condor instances.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jan-28 15:40", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Mar-03 13:38", "fixed_version": "2009-Mar-03 13:38", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
