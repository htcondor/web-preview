{"id": 4925, "title": "Ticket #4925: Create a \"subdag versus splice\" wiki entry", "description": "<blockquote>\nI think it would be good to have a \"sub-DAG versus splice\" entry in the HTCondor Wiki.  This could include the advantages and disadvantages of each one, and when you'd want to use one versus the other.  It also could include some \"tricks\", especially for using splices; for example:\n<ul>\n<li>NOOP nodes before and after the splice to attach PRE and POST scripts.\n</li><li>A NOOP node between splices to prevent possible combinatorial explosion of dependencies.\n</li><li>Probably a bunch of other stuff I'm not thinking of at the moment...</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Jun-10 16:50:09 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nSee <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j6XIE6R3_g7aUcWFjMiBRrPTHtIGbWdo96XdTof22NU/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j6XIE6R3_g7aUcWFjMiBRrPTHtIGbWdo96XdTof22NU/edit?usp=sharing</a> for preliminary version.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Jun-14 11:03:13 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nSee <a class=\"external\" href=\"/wiki-archive/pages/SubDagsVsSplices\">SubDagsVsSplices</a> for the Wiki document.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Jun-16 13:08:23 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nLauren and Christina would like this to go into the regular manual as well.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Jun-17 09:53:39 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI've linked the wiki entry to the howto recipes page.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Jun-17 09:54:34 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOh, yeah -- Lauren and Christina are going to give me some feedback on this and hopefully come up with some better terminology.
