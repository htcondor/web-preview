{"id": 3793, "title": "Ticket #3793: missing build dependency for std_local_ref", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen doing a uw-style build with a large make -jN number (eg, -j24), I consistently hit a build dependency where the rule to generate receivers.cpp gets run before stub_gen is built (which is the utility used to generate receivers.cpp).\n\n<p>This doesn't usually come up with smaller -jN's, since an earlier rule ends up building stub_gen in time, but there is no explicit dependency on it.  (There is a receivers target that depends on stub_gen, but there is also a std_local_ref target, which has a rule to build receivers.cpp, but this does not depend on stub_gen or the receivers target.)\n\n</p><p>One way to address this is to add a cmake dependency for receivers (and senders) on stub_gen.  This seems to work, but the result is receivers.cpp gets generated twice once stub_gen is built; once for the receivers target and once for std_local_ref.\n\n</p><p>Another way (my preference) would be to add a cmake dependency for std_local_ref on receivers (and senders).  This adds an implicit dependency on stub_gen and avoids regenerating the .cpp files.  There are similar looking holes for switches.cpp, which I think should be addressed the same way.\n\n</p><p>My suggestion is to patch src/condor_syscall_lib/CMakeLists.txt like this:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">--- a/src/condor_syscall_lib/CMakeLists.txt\n+++ b/src/condor_syscall_lib/CMakeLists.txt\n@@ -125,13 +125,14 @@ if( STD_UNIVERSE )\n \t# part 2:\n \t# set dependencies to ensure build dep order for parallel builds\n \t##################################################\n-\tadd_dependencies( condorsyscall stub_gen )\n+\tadd_dependencies( condorsyscall senders switches )\n \tif (DOES_COMPRESS_CKPT)\n-\t\tadd_dependencies( condorzsyscall stub_gen )\n+\t\tadd_dependencies( condorzsyscall senders switches )\n \tendif()\n \tadd_dependencies( switches syscall_numbers stub_gen )\n \tadd_dependencies( senders syscall_numbers stub_gen )\n \tadd_dependencies( receivers syscall_numbers stub_gen )\n+\tadd_dependencies( std_local_ref senders receivers )\n \tadd_dependencies( sys-list syscall_numbers stub_gen )\n\n \t#################################################\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This fix worked for me, but I'd like to put this out here in case anyone thinks there's a better way to address it.
