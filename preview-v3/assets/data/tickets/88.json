This feature is useful, but the error messages themselves are often too general. For example, you may get something like: \"failure to chown sandbox\". It would be more useful to get the exact system call errno or what safety check failed. Perhaps more useful would be something like an \"error stack\".\n\n<p>It may also be useful to allow warning messages to be propagated up to the calling daemon in addition to errors. For example, \"recursive chown complete, but some FS nodes left alone due to wrong ownership\" (See <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=86\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('86'); return false;\" title='PrivSep chown operation should be \"best-effort\"'>#86</a></span>).\n\n</p><p>Of course, however this is improved we need to keep it simple since this is in the root-enabled portion of Condor's <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> architecture.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:20", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-23 16:45", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-23 16:45", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
