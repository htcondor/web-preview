When an object is deleted, it's removed from the hashtable. But the key was constructed incorrectly when doing the removal. Then, a later lookup returns a bad pointer, whose use will corrupt memory.\n\n<p>This will happen when some jobs are submitted for a resource, they all complete and leave the queue, then another set of jobs are submitted destined for the same resource.\n\n</p><p>This problem was reported by Rod Walker. He was seeing a crash every 1-2 hours on some of his machines.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-May-05 13:37</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/8420cd4c955f67723d508e80ab045c8ecb3664eb\">[21791]</a></span>: Fix bad key in hashtable removal in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CreamResource\" title=\"Cream Resource\">CreamResource</a></span>. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2127\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2127'); return false;\" title=\"Gridmanager crash caused by bad CreamResource hashtable managment\">#2127</a></span> When a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CreamResource\" title=\"Cream Resource\">CreamResource</a></span> is deleted, it's removed from a hashtable of all instantiated <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CreamResource\" title=\"Cream Resource\">CreamResource</a></span> objects.
