{"id": 6614, "title": "Ticket #6614: STARTD_RECOMPUTE_DISK_FREE ignored during dslot creation", "description": "<blockquote>\nthe knob <code>STARTD_RECOMPUTE_DISK_FREE</code> is ignored during dslot creation, but honored during later updates.  This has the effect of creating the dslot using a percentage that is derived from the pslot's <code>c_total_disk</code> (which hasn't updated since the startd started) and applied to the current disk free space at the time dslot is created.   This can result in under-provisioning of the dslot DISK attribute, which then causes the job not to match.\n\n<p>Todd Tannenbaum also pointed out that we should make sure that the initial value of Disk in the pslot should be set only <strong>after</strong> the startd has done its initial cleanup of the execute directory.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-May-10 10:09:52 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong>  All is good.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Mar-20 14:10</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/2209e2aff2d4311c76b43a25af4dbeef8e294a96\">[54539]</a></span>: fix for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6614\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6614'); return false;\" title=\"STARTD_RECOMPUTE_DISK_FREE ignored during dslot creation\">#6614</a></span>, STARD_RECOMPUTE_DISK_FREE ignored when creating dynamic slots.
