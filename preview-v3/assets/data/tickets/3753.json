{"id": 3753, "title": "Ticket #3753: DMTCP checkpoint resumes must require original CheckpointPlatform", "description": "<blockquote>\nTo summarize the Condor-LIGO call discussion, Alan thinks the ideal fix is non-trivial, but Todd believes just adding a Chirp command to the shim script to edit the requirements would be an easy fix in the interim.  LIGO is fine with that.\n\n<p>A poor workaround requiring user effort (and careful attention to pool composition) is to require a specific <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CheckpointPlatform\" title=\"Checkpoint Platform\">CheckpointPlatform</a></span> at submit time.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jul-11 16:34:14 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nChirp seems reasonable.  The challenge is that step 1 of sending the chirp command is \"find condor_chirp\".\n\n<p>HTCondor doesn't provide any tools for finding it on the execute node, which could be a pain in the ass.  Probably not the option I'd take.

This adds another detail to get right: we need to find it locally (an easier problem, and one we can punt to the end user), we need to add it to our transfer_input_files (easy), and we need to include all of the required HTCondor-specific libraries (16 as of 8.0.1 on RHEL6).  A pain in butt, but probably the easier solution.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-22 14:08:35 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nClosing this for now; KVM checkpointing looks much more promising.
