I've been unable to reproduce this problem and it hasn't reoccurred on Rod Walker's machines. I'm deferring this ticket until we have more information.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Dec-01 15:30:01 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI now understand why this bug occurs. When a lease update attempt fails, the gridmanager sets LastJobLeaseRenewalFailed=True in the job ad. On subsequent update attempts, the expiration time from the first failed attempted is used until there's a successful update, even if that expiration time elapses. When a lease is shared across multiple jobs, this poisons all of the jobs, as the earliest expiration time is used.\n\n<p>The lease management code in the gridmanager needs to be overhauled. As a short-term fix, we can ignore <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LastJobLeaseRenewalFailed\" title=\"Last Job Lease Renewal Failed\">LastJobLeaseRenewalFailed</a></span> and always base the new lease expiration time on the current time.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Dec-05 14:00:38 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI've pushed a patch to V7_6-branch and posted a pre-release binary for Rod Walker, Xin Zhao and Igor Sfiligoi to try: <a class=\"external\" href=\"ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/condor/temporary/forrod/2011-12-01/condor_gridmanager\">ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/condor/temporary/forrod/2011-12-01/condor_gridmanager</a>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jan-06 14:32:40 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nRod Walker reports that lease problems have not reoccurred since installing the patched binary.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Jan-06 14:34</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/8ce41fb668d811b85eb52b4dff282f3ef35eac41\">[29018]</a></span>: Add CREAM lease fixes to version history. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2351\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2351'); return false;\" title=\"Ensure CREAM lease exists before submitting job in gridmanager\">#2351</a></span> <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2455\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2455'); return false;\" title=\"CREAM leases set in the past\">#2455</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Dec-01 15:49</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/93fd684344af7cb8128e07de65ab874c5ec513c2\">[28532]</a></span>: Disable use of <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LastJobLeaseRenewalFailed\" title=\"Last Job Lease Renewal Failed\">LastJobLeaseRenewalFailed</a></span> in CalculateJobLease(). <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2455\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2455'); return false;\" title=\"CREAM leases set in the past\">#2455</a></span> When a job lease update fails, this attribute causes subsequent update attempts to use the same expiration time, even if that time has since elapsed.
