However, since 8.3.2 does not support shared_port and dual stack anyway, this ticket can be considered internal.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n1.  As far as I can tell, it's a bug that the collector is trying to bind to a UDP port when shared port is enabled at all.  The port should never be used.  (Who would the collector ever tell about it?  I guess maybe a collector tree, but it seems like this shouldn't generally be happening.)\n\n<p>That being said, I think you've misidentified the code's assumption.  The target ports can only differ from the requested ports if the requested ports were dynamically assigned.  If they are, then we assume that InitCommandSocket() (singular) will do what it's supposed to and fail if it can't bind both the TCP and the UDP port.\n\n</p><p>In point of actual fact, I don't think it does -- neither TJ nor I could find where, if InitCommandSocket() were given fixed port numbers, it actually binds the TCP port.  Our best guess as to why it actually works right now is that the master uses a different method when it creates sockets for people to inherit, and nobody ever actually asks for an extra command socket on a specified port.  This would tend to imply the master isn't doing the right thing here, but I need to investigate further.\n\n</p><p>2. I'm certain I tested this.  I may have missed something, but I'm sure I tested it -- so I'd like to know what, precisely, is broken.\n\n</p><p>The address rewriting code should never see an IP address other than the first command socket's -- we (should) never insert anything else.  I don't necessarily object to checking all of sinfuls, just to be safe, but I think something else is going on.\n\n</p><p>Have you verified that the on-disk shared port ad contains an IPv6 address?  The shared port daemon uses the initial command socket (as we would expect) to populate the ad, and address rewriting only occurs when sending <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> over the wire.  (And only when the address in question is the address of the sender, because we don't otherwise know what to substitute.)\n\n</p><p>More generally, yes, even an IPv4-only client is going to see IPv6 addresses in the collector.  There's nothing we can do about that; we plan to avoid the problem with matchmaking, in the future.\n\n</p><p>3. I don't recall it at the moment -- more later, possibly, or maybe on Tuesday when Alan gets back -- but there's a really good reason we can't rewrite based only on IP address; it may not apply in this special case.  I guess we could offer a knob to force the collector to rewrite other people's ads?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jan-17 07:48:35 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Todd,\n\n<p>Thanks for the review.  A few responses.\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>When the collector and shared_port are enabled (and if COLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT is left to the default of true), then the shared_port will listen on TCP 9618 (forwarding non-shared-port requests to the collector).  Then, the collector will bind to UDP 9618 and a dynamic TCP port (this is because the remote daemons will still try to update via UDP).  Hence, for the case where the collector host is using shared port, <code>port=-1</code> and <code>udp_port=9618</code>.  However, the code <div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>targetTCPPort = targetUDPPort = rs-&gt;get_port();</pre></div>\n make an invalid assumption that <code>port = udp_port</code>. This causes the collector to break when shared_port is enabled in master.\n</li><li>Yes, when you tested it, this worked correctly.  However, when we fixed <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4830\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4830'); return false;\" title=\"Bug: unnecessary socket creation\">#4830</a></span>, the daemons started connecting to the collector using IPv6 (as designed) - including the collector itself!  This means the collector ad contained the collector's IPv6 address - no longer IPv4.  When subsequently serving the collector ad - which contains the IPv6 address, but the initial command socket is IPv4 - address rewriting breaks.\n</li><li>Yeah, I went back and forth whether to rewrite based on (IP address) or (IP address+port+using shared_port).  I picked the less conservative choice in the commit; however, rewriting only sinfuls on the same shared port server would be fine with me and fix this use case.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jan-23 14:39:49 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBroken into three tickets:\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4847\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4847'); return false;\" title=\"Collector doesn't listen on UDP 9618 with shared_port, IPv6, and IPv4\">#4847</a></span>: Collector doesn't listen on UDP 9618 with shared_port, IPv6, and IPv4\n</li><li><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4848\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4848'); return false;\" title=\"Address rewriting only considers first command socket\">#4848</a></span>: Address rewriting only considers first command socket\n</li><li><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4849\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4849'); return false;\" title=\"Rewrite all ads leaving collector on single-node pool\">#4849</a></span>: Rewrite all ads leaving collector on single-node pool\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>This ticket is now obsolete.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Jan-14 22:08</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/8607a299523c637da915d24d4da5408b7ef40309\">[42222]</a></span>: Fix various IPv6 issues. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4833\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4833'); return false;\" title=\"IPv6 bugfixes for 8.3.2\">#4833</a></span> In particular: 1) Make sure the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=InitCommandSockets\" title=\"Init Command Sockets\">InitCommandSockets</a></span> code does not rely on the TCP port and UDP port being the same.
