Condor is a distributed batch processing system for UNIX developed
at the University of Wisconsin.  This system schedules jobs on idle
workstations in a network, resulting in more efficient resource
utilization.  It is of primary importance in Condor to ensure that the
owner of a workstation does not pay a penalty for adding his or her
workstation to the Condor pool of workstations.  So, a job must have
the ability to immediately vacate a workstation when the owner begins
to use it, and either migrate to another idle workstation or queue
until one becomes idle.
<P>
To allow migrating jobs to make progress, Condor must be able to start
the vacated job from where it left off.  Condor does this by writing a
checkpoint of the process's state before vacating.  A checkpoint file
contains the process's data and stack segments, as well as information
about open files, pending signals, and CPU state.  Condor gives a
program the ability to checkpoint itself by providing a checkpointing
library.  Programs submitted to be run by the Condor system are
re-linked (but not re-compiled) to include this library.
