These are the changes Jeff made to clean up the distribution

1) Remove the ifdefs from the top of MWDriver.C

This code is in the RMCOMM class itself.  This class is responsible
for creating and initializing the static member of the MWDriver and
MWWorker, and MWTask classes.


Premise --
RMComm developers should *not* have to touch the MW code.  Just do
what we tell them to!!!

(So why is independent different from this?)

Independent is different because you only want to have ONE process.
Therefore the code muct be able to "change context" between the master
and worker processes.

You will have to keep the code in MWDriver and MWWorker 
	(or have different versions)




Changes on 6/30 

Fixed bug.  RMComm should not call processExec() if requirements is NULL

Changing some spelling errors and ambiguous messages of Sanjeev

Changed logic in MWFiles so that if target_num_workers was not reasonable, things would still run.

Jeff was a bum and didn't write down any of the other numerous changes
that he made while Sanjeev was gone.


A few just recent ones that he can remember.

-- Signal handling.  User can kill _INT the master, and it will
   checkpoint and coredump.

-- addSortedTasks()

-- A few little bugs and suggestions to make things work with Basney's
   new and much improved condor_shadow.pvm
