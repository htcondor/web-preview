Bad machine usage.  The tree isn't "fat" enough to accomidate all the
workers.  (Towards the end, all of the workers are waiting on one (or
a small number) of processors to perform their tasks)

Uh, oh-- maybe DFS is bad? I would try reducing the grain size
first, though.

Notes -- I think it would be better if the grain size was > 100
seconds.  It seems to be taking nearly that long to process the top
node of the subtree, and you get less benefit from going depth first.

(Maybe you should run this one with -DDEBUG_DFS)


Also, again the tree is too skinny for this problem.  We have many
workers just waiting on one or two processors to finish up the tree.
:-(

You are getting a lot of "worker" exits -- probably you are adding too 
many cuts!  Look into this.


danoint was taking a long time to solve.  Need to have "good"
priority, so I quit it.
