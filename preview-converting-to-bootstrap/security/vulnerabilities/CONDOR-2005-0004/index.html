    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  Since this vulnerability can affect the configuration of all Condor
  components running on a machine, it can have consequences ranging from
  changing the matching criteria of jobs (to only allow matches from a
  particular user), to denial of service (by not starting components), to full
  root access.
<p>  If Condor is configured to start as root, condor_master is started on the
  machine as root, and it takes care of starting the appropriate Condor
  components as defined in the configuration files.  It starts these as root
  and the individual components then change their effective id to the condor
  uid for most of their operation and other uids as needed.  Since the
  components to start and the paths to the components are in the configuration,
  these can be changed to start a new malicious daemon, or to change the path
  of an existing daemon to a malicious one, which can then exec the real daemon
  to hide the fact that it was run.  Since all daemons are started as root, the
  malicious ones will be also be run with the root uid.

</tr>
<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  In order to allow runtime configuration changes which are persistent between
  restarts of Condor components, changes to the configuration for a component
  are stored in hidden files in the Condor log directory.  This directory and
  the files written are owned by the condor user.
<p>  Condor has a set of configuration attributes (see SETTABLE_ATTRS) to restrict
  what setting can be changed for what components, and by whom, but these are
  only checked when an attempt is made to change the setting using the
  <code>condor_config_val</code> program by the targeted component.
<p>  When <code>condor_config_val</code> is used to change an attribute ($ATTR,
  $UATTR is the same as $ATTR in all uppercase) to a value ($VALUE) of the
  component ($COMP which is all uppercase without the condor_ prefix),
  two files are modified or created in the Condor log directory ($LOG):
<p>  <dl><dt>$LOG/.config.$COMP:<dd>RUNTIME_CONFIG_ADMIN = $ATTR
  [, $ATTR<i>n</i>]...
  <dt>$LOG/.config.$COMP.$ATTR:<dd>$UATTR = $VALUE
  </dl>
<p>  For instance, if you had access to the condor account on a machine that a
  condor_schedd ran on, you could add the following two files:
<p>  <dl><dt>$LOG/.config.MASTER:<dd>RUNTIME_CONFIG_ADMIN = schedd
  <dt>$LOG/.config.MASTER.schedd:<dd>SCHEDD = <i>malicious_program_path</i>
  </dl>
<p>  You would then need to get the condor component (condor_schedd) to restart on
  this machine.  This could be accomplished by killing the component and having
  the condor_master restart things automatically, rebooting the system, or
  using the condor_reconfig which is supposed to reread the configuration files
  (including the ones in the $(LOG) directory) and reconfigure and restart
  things as appropriate (this does not work in the current example due to a bug
  in the condor_master).

</tr>
<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  The cause of this is a failure to validate the values held in these
  configuration files against permissible values (this is only done when
  setting values using the condor_config_val program).  It is also caused by
  these files being stored with permissions and ownership such that the condor
  uid can update and create these files. They should only be allowed to be
  created and modified by the root uid.

    <td class='sv'><p class='v'>&nbsp;</p></td>

<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  In a configuration where condor_master and other components are started as
  root and the configuration files determine what executables are run, all
  configuration files need to be owned by root.  Otherwise having access to the
  condor uid is the same as having access to the root uid.  Several things
  should be done to prevent this vulnerability.
<p>  First, a union of all the configuration attributes of the form
  [<i>SUBSYS</i>_]SETTABLE_ATTRS_<i>PERMISSION-LEVEL</i> should be made and
  only the attributes in the union should be allowed to be set.  A good
  practice would be to only allow settings which do not affect which external
  programs are executed, what uids are used, and any other setting which may
  compromise security.
<p>  Second, the owner of the runtime configuration files should be root and
  should have permissions that only allow root to update these files.  This can
  be accomplished in one of two ways.  The files could be placed in a separate
  directory whose ancestors are all owned by root to prevent deletion and
  replacement of the file, with a check to verify this on every access.
  Another solution would be to write the files in the log directory as they are
  now, but to write the files with a owner of root and with sufficient
  privileges so that only root can update them.  Then after the file is opened,
  but before it is processed, an fstat could be done on the file descriptor to
  determine the owner and privileges to verify that only root could change the
  file.  If they are valid then process the file, otherwise do not process
  the file.
<p>  If a mechanism already exists for distributing configuration files or they
  are placed in a shared file system, it would be best to disable all but user
  defined attributes on a host, and to use the distribution method to change
  system configuration options.
<p>  Lastly, these configuration files should be shown the light of day by
  documenting them, not hiding them in the file system (by not starting their
  names with a dot and putting them all in their own subdirectory), and listing
  them when using the condor_config_val command with the -v option.

    <td class='sv'><p class='v'>&nbsp;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  The persistent configuration files that are written by the daemons when set
  through condor_config_val are now checked to verify that they are owned by
  the real user of the condor daemon (root or the "condor" user).
<p>  Also, the feature to allow dynamic and persistent configuration changes
  through condor_config_val is now controlled by three new configuration
  options: ENABLE_RUNTIME_CONFIG, ENABLE_PERSISTENT_CONFIG and
  PERSISTENT_CONFIG_DIR.  The configuration options ENABLE_RUNTIME_CONFIG and
  ENABLE_PERSISTENT_CONFIG default to disabled.  If they are both enabled, the
  path in PERSISTENT_CONFIG_DIR is used as the directory to contain the files.
