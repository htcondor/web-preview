{"id": 2881, "title": "Ticket #2881: Change default DMTCP checkpoint interval", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom Michael Hanke:\n\n<p>Right now the default interval set in the shim script is 1800 sec.\nDepending on the job and the pool configuration this may be either too\nshort or too long. What do you think about setting the default interval\nto 0, i.e. no regular snapshotting at all?\n\n</p><p>This would have the benefit of the least impact on the job performance\n(no repeated snapshotting, no repeated compression of the snapshot on\nthe execute machine). But at the same time it would preserve the most\nvaluable benefit -- make vanilla job survive a preemption.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Mar-12 11:51:44 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nFor comparison, the default configuration for Condor with the standard universe sets PERIODIC_CHECKPOINT to \"$(LastCkpt) &gt; (3 * $(HOUR) + $RANDOM_INTEGER(-30,30,1) * $(MINUTE) )\", which is a random time between 2.5 and 3.5 hours.  Perhaps the answer is to increase the default checkpoint interval to 3 hours?</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Mar-13 14:31", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Mar-12 11:46", "fixed_version": "2012-Mar-12 11:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "mih@debian.org", "due_date": ""}
