Other than the gratuitious changes to slot_builder.cpp, the new code in the startd is (almost) entirely disabled when consumption policy is not configured.\n\n<p>There is some new code for param'ing SLOT_WEIGHTS which will abort the STARTD if the slot weight expression does not parse. It's not clear to me whether this code is a useful but unrelated change, if it's purely for consumption policy use then it should be disabled unless consumption policy is enabled.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Oct-11 17:06:34 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nNOTE : this bug was never actually released, so no need for a version history entry.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Oct-10 17:40</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/662b092cdc24981fcbb799a1e9e1678db23009ed\">[37815]</a></span>: Add support for Consumption Policies, aka negotiator slot splits. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3435\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3435'); return false;\" title=\"negotiator-side resource consumption with consumption policies\">#3435</a></span> Squashed commit of the following:\u00a0[...]\n (By Erik Erlandson )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jul-27 16:35</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/4bd9e44ab41bb56da07165a3f09d75218b807ec0\">[37026]</a></span>: Support consumption policies and multiple matches against partitionable slots ===GT:Fixed=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3435\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3435'); return false;\" title=\"negotiator-side resource consumption with consumption policies\">#3435</a></span> <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3792\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3792'); return false;\" title=\"Claim handling for consumption policies causes crash in startd\">#3792</a></span>  (By Erik Erlandson )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Oct-11 17:06", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Jul-18 16:15", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-18 16:15", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "#3435", "creator": "eje", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "eje@cs.wisc.edu, matt@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com, gthain@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
