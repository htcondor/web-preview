{"id": 1860, "title": "Ticket #1860: Condor_hold of DAG on Windows removes node jobs?", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis is really in the schedd, but it's DAG-related, so I'm sticking it in the DAGMan category.  Anyhow, there's Windows-only code in the schedd to remove node jobs when DAGMan is removed; however, I think this code will also remove the node jobs on a condor_hold of the DAG job, which is different than the behavior on all other platforms.\n\n<p>Here's the comment for this code (in schedd.cpp).\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  /*  This is a small patch so when DAGMan jobs are removed\n      on Win32, jobs submitted by the DAGMan are removed as well.\n      This patch is small and acceptable for the 6.8 stable series,\n      but for v6.9 and beyond we should remove this patch and have things\n      work on Win32 the same way they work on Unix.  However, doing this\n      was deemed to much code churning for a stable series, thus this\n      simpler but temporary patch.  -Todd 8/2006.\n  */\n</pre>\n\n<p>I don't know what the motivation was for putting this code in in the first place, unless DAGMan on Windows was not correctly removing its children.  I don't remember that being the case, though...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jan-20 11:35:06 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nSee also <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=741\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('741'); return false;\" title=\"Code Cleanup: WIN32 DAGMan hack in schedd.cpp\">#741</a></span>, please pick one and mark the other abandoned.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-22 13:47:33 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, I forgot to search the existing tickets when I created this one.
