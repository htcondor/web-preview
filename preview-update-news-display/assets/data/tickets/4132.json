If I set NO_DNS=TRUE and set up a personal HTCondor, everything works as expected.\n\n</p><p>tlmiller's virtual machines have no DNS.  If I set NO_DNS=TRUE, the condor_master is unable to recognize that it's own IP address is present in COLLECTOR_HOST, and from that determine the correct port.  As a result, it uses 9618 in all cases.\n\n</p><p>This needs investigation.  My intial guess is that HTCondor is using DNS anyway to try and find localhost's IP address.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Dec-20 14:14", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Dec-20 14:14", "fixed_version": "2013-Dec-20 14:14", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
