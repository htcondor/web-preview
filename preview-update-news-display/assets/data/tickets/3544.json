Can now reproduce (even in the debugger!).  Confirmed that the problem is that glibc caches __cpu_features and calls optimized routines as indicated; in this particular case, HTCondor code was calling strcmp() (in order to deal with the file table).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-10 16:27:47 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nOur heavy-hearted decision, made with tears in our eyes, is that we have to partition the pool, and add the bits that glibc cares about to the standard universe platform string.\n\n<p>Based on code inspection, those bits appear to be SSSE 3, SSE 4.1, and SSE 4.2; although the glibc code uses two other bits, having them set wrong will only incur a performance penalty.  (\"Prefers SSE for memory operations\" and \"Fast REP string\".  The latter instruction prefix exists on all x86 processors, but are only faster than the alternative on some; SSE has existed since the Pentium III, so I don't think we need to worry about detecting it.)  I've confirmed that (shockingly) the Linux kernel and glibc agree about which bits mean what, so we can simply grovel in /proc/cpuinfo and add which of those flags are present to the checkpoint platform string.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-11 14:21:35 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong class=\"two\">DESIGN PARAGRAPHS</strong>\n\n<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong>\n\n</p><p>A series of optimized functions in glibc are causing the standard universe grief: by detecting, at the time of the first call to these functions, if the processor supports particular instruction set extensions (SSE2, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2), glibc can improve its performance.  Naturally, the detection is cached, so if we restart a checkpointed job on a machine without those extensions, the process will execute an illegal instruction the next time it calls these functions.\n\n</p><p><strong>SOLUTIONS</strong>\n\n</p><p>One option for a solution is to hack glibc never to use these optimized functions.  This has the advantage of keeping the pool unfragmented, but has two major disadvantages: it removes what glibc thinks is a worthwhile speedup, but more importantly, requires us to maintain another patch for glibc.  We would rather, in fact, be <em>removing</em> patches, rather than adding them.\n\n</p><p>Because this decision is made by glibc at runtime, we also can't solve this problem with matchmaking -- before start-up, the job could run on any machine.  Luckily, we already have a mechanism in place to handle this problem: the checkpoint platform (string).  By extending the platform string to include the bits that glibc cares about, we can partition the pool but also make sure that jobs don't crash after they migrate.\n\n</p><p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION</strong>\n\n</p><p>The sysapi already grovels /proc/cpuinfo, so we'll start there.  (This makes sense: as far as we know, nobody else <em>uses</em> glibc.)  We'll do two things with the attributes glibc cares about: advertise them, and add them to the checkpoint platform string.\n\n</p><p>By advertising them as individual attributes, we make it easier for admins to add new ones as or should they become necessary, and improve the ability of condor_q to analyze them usefully.  (We could just forward the 'flags' field into the job ad, substituting commas for spaces, in order to use the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> match-out-of-the-list function; but that would be harder to analyze.  It would also either include a lot of useless information or be harder to extend, when something new shows up.)  It will also standardize the representation of these attributes, which will help pools interoperate.\n\n</p><p>Likewise, we'll leave the existing patch in place, so that the checkpoint platform string can be updated by administrators as necessary.  (That is, before we the developers hear about the problem.)\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-20 16:38:46 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\n<span class=\"section\"><h2>Code Review</h2></span>\n\n<p>Code passes as is.\n\n</p><p><strong>strongly recommended</strong> The idiom \"Check for ATTR_CHECKPOINT_PLATFORM, fall back to sysapi_ckptpltfrm\" <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/a848dbf3e565ce1e5bd6b67733d6bedffaf591b2\">[35281]</a></span> repeats several times .
