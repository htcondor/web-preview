{"id": 4066, "title": "Ticket #4066: batch_test.pl: Repeated runs slow down tests", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf you run the the full set of tests repeatedly (say, because you're bisecting a bug, or just doing incremental development), the tests will eventually get unusably slow, going from taking a few hours to taking a day or more.  This should be fixed.\n\n<p>Hypothesis: the problem is that various log files continue to accumulate between runs, and the testing code is re-reading them from the start, probably repeatedly.  If this is the case, ideally each test should set LOG to a private directory; failing that when a test finishes, it should move the logs to a private directory to leave LOG ready for the next test.  This will probably increase the speed of all tests.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Nov-14 14:20:04 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nbt believes --isolated will solve the problem; tests won't share a single set of log files.
