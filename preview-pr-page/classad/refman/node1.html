Overview</A>
</H1>

<P>
This document provides a formal specification of the syntax and
semantics of the <I>ClassAd</I> (Classified Advertisement) language.
The name of the language derives from its origin in the Condor distributed
computing system&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#CONDOR_EXP">7</A>,<A
 HREF="node6.html#CONDOR_HUNT">8</A>], where it is used for discovery
and allocation of resources.  Providers of computing resources submit
advertisements describing their capabilities and declaring constraints and
preferences for jobs they are willing to run.  Consumers submit ads
describing their jobs.  Like the provider ads, these ads may impose constraints
and express preferences regarding execution sites.  A <I>matchmaker</I> process
matches the producer and consumer ads.  All policy considerations are contained
in the ads themselves; the matchmaker merely supplies the mechanism for
interpreting the policies expressed in the ClassAd language.  The present
document only defines the language. This introduction hints at how the language
can be used to express a variety of scheduling policies, but a full discussion
of this issue is beyond the scope of this document.

<P>
The ClassAd language is a functional language.  The basic unit is the
<I>expression</I>, and execution entails <I>evaluation</I> of expressions,
replacing an expression with its <I>normal form</I> or <I>value</I>.  There are
no side-effects: Evaluation has no effect other than calculating the value of
an expression.
The language is carefully designed to allow efficient evaluation.  In
particular, an expression can be evaluated in time proportional to the size of
the expression.<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot29"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>
The most important type of expression is a <I>record expression</I> (sometimes
called a ``classad''), which is a set of name/value pairs.  The ``value'' in
each pair may be an arbitrarily complex expression, including nested record
expressions and lists of expressions.  An example is
<PRE>
    [
        type = "gizmo";
        components = {
            [ type = "widget"; part_number = 12394 ],
            [ type = "widget"; part_number = 92348 ]
        };
        main_component = components[0];
        main_part = main_component.part_number;
    ]
</PRE>

<P>
ClassAd expressions are strongly but dynamically typed.   Supported types
include integral and floating-point numbers, Boolean values (<B>true</B> and
<B>false</B>), character strings, timestamps, and time intervals.  During the
evaluation, invalid sub-expressions evaluate to the value <B>error</B>.  For
example, <code>1/0</code>, <code>3 * "abc"</code>, <code>{1, 2, 3}[5]</code>, and <code>27[5]</code>
all evaluate to <B>error</B>.  Attribute references (occurrences of
identifiers on the right-hand side of attribute definitions) are replaced by
their definitions.  Attribute names with no definition or circular definitions
evaluate to <B>undefined</B>.  Attribute lookup is ``block structured'':  An
attribute reference is resolved by searching all record expressions containing
the reference, from innermost outward, for a matching definition (this matching
is case-insensitive).  For example, the expression
<PRE>
    [
        a = 1; b = c;
        d = [ f = g; i = a; j = c; k = l; a = 2; ]
        l = d.k; c = 3;
    ]
</PRE>
evaluates to
<PRE>
    [
        a = 1; b = 3;
        d = [ f = undefined; i = 2; j = 3; k = undefined; a = 2; ]
        l = undefined; c = 3
    ]
</PRE>

<P>
There are currently two implementations of the ClassAd language, one in C++ and
one in Java.  Both implementations should have identical external behavior
conforming to this specification.<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="#foot42"><SUP>2</SUP></A>  In both implementations, ClassAd
expressions are tree-structured objects.  Each implementation provides methods
for constructing expressions, navigating through them, and evaluating them, as
well as methods for translating between the internal data structures and
character strings using either of two <I>concrete syntaxes</I>, the ``native
representation'' used in the examples above and XML&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#XML">4</A>].

<P>
An important application of ClassAds is <I>matchmaking</I>.  Matchmaking is
applied to a pair <I>A</I>, <I>B</I> of record expressions, each of which is expected to
have a ``top-level'' definition of the attribute <TT>Requirements</TT>.  The
<TT>Requirements</TT> attribute of <I>A</I> is evaluated in an
environment in which the attribute reference <TT>other</TT> evaluates to <I>B</I>,
and <TT>B.Requirements</TT> is evaluated in an environment in which
<TT>other</TT> evaluates to <I>A</I>,
If both <TT>Requirements</TT> attributes evaluate to the specific value
<B>true</B> (not <B>undefined</B>, <B>error</B>, or a value of some
non-Boolean type), the expressions <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> are said to <I>match</I>.  In
Condor, matchmaking is used to match <I>job</I> and <I>machine</I> ads.  A
machine ad describes the characteristics and current state of a machine.  It
also has a <TT>Requirements</TT> attribute to restrict the set of jobs it is
willing to run and a <TT>Rank</TT> attribute to indicate how much it ``likes''
an individual job.  <TT>Rank</TT> should evaluate to a non-negative integer,
with higher values indicating preferred jobs.  Similarly, a job ad has
descriptive attributes, a <TT>Requirements</TT> attribute to constrain the set
of acceptable machines, and a <TT>Rank</TT> attribute to express preferences.
The Condor matchmaker uses these attributes to match jobs with machines.

<DD>Actually, this statement is only true if
each function call completes within a time bound proportional to the length
of its arguments.
All ``built-in'' functions have this property.

<DD>Of course, this is an idealized
goal.  As of this writing, there are several ways in which the
two implementations differ from each other and from this specification.  An
effort is underway to improve conformance.
