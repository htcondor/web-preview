All the infrastructure is in place to do so (from the prior X509 work) but is currently not implemented.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:05", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Aug-31 17:09", "fixed_version": "2020-Aug-31 17:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "fermi", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelman@morgridge.org tannenba@cs.wisc.edu zmiller@cs.wisc.edu maltunay@fnal.gov fkhan@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
