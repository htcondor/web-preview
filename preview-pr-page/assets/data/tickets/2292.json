Sending  signal 11 again causes the program to terminate as expected.  If instead you send, say, signal 9, the program terminate with signal 9.\n\n</p><p>Relevant code is <a class=\"file\" href=\"rlog?f=src/condor_utils/dprintf_config.cpp\">/src/condor_utils/dprintf_config.cpp</a> around line 68 in sig_backtrace_handler(int signum).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jul-13 14:09:27 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\ncondor_master does not exhibit the same behavior.

Code continues to malfunction (hang on receiving signal 11).  After a few attempts at debugging with gdb, suddenly it works as expected.  I re-add the call to dprintf_dump_stack.  It still works. Whatever is going wrong appears to be subtle.\n\n<p>Either way, I'm tentatively ruling out dprintf_dump_stack as the culprit, as I have seen things work and not work both with and without it.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Jul-13 15:34", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Jul-08 17:55", "fixed_version": "2011-Jul-08 17:55", "broken_version": "v070701", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
