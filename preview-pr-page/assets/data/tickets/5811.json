{"id": 5811, "title": "Ticket #5811: After shared_port restart, endpoint should quickly check for addr.", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe function SharedPortEndpoint::RetryInitRemoteAddress() unconditionally waits for sixty seconds after it fails to find the shared port daemon's address file.  Instead, on the initial startup and after each restart, we should try again after a (few) seconds(s) because with the exception of CCB, we're just waiting for the shared_port daemon to start and write out a file, which shouldn't take very long and unnecessarily delays start-up.\n\n<p>Doing so minimizes the window where the master will not have an address after the shared_port daemon crashes.  (A faster restart of the shared port daemon may also be wise.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jul-27 15:44", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jul-27 15:43", "fixed_version": "2016-Jul-27 15:43", "broken_version": "v080409", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonSharedP", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5801", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
