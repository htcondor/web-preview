{"id": 4297, "title": "Ticket #4297: Prototype vanilla universe self-checkpointing support.", "description": "<blockquote>\n(Also see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4968\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4968'); return false;\" title=\"Periodic Application-Level Checkpoints in the Vanilla Universe\">#4968</a></span>, this ticket's new parent.)\n\n<p>I have code that will eat your babies.  It will also periodically send a vanilla-universe job its \"soft kill\" signal (defaults to <code>SIGTERM</code>, can be adjusted via the submit-file attribute <code>kill_sig</code>), at intervals defined by the <code>PERIODIC_CHECKPOINT</code> (as respected by the standard and VM universes).  It does so if and only if the job ad has <code>WantCheckpoint</code> and <code>UserLevelCheckpoint</code> set.  Immediately after sending the signal, it performs intermediate file transfer.\n\n</p><p>Under the above two conditions, this will result in periodic application-level checkpointing, with the caveat that the checkpoint stored by the shadow will always be one checkpoint interval old.\n\n</p><p>If you would like this code to eat your babies, let me know for which platform and I'll send you the binaries.  I would like to see if this approach can be made to work for people in practice before trying to clean it up.\n\n</p><p>Obvious extensions include: some way of telling when the application is done checkpointing (watch a signal file?), which could be tricky, but would weaken condition (b), above; adding another job attribute to specify the checkpoint signal distinct from the kill signal, which should be simple but may be useless; and making the intermediate files go some place more useful than the shadow, which will probably be a pain.\n\n</p><p>This is <em>not</em> any other ticket.  (;)) In particular, it does not address the general use of third-party checkpointing.  It does not address the use of standard universe binaries in stand-alone mode.  It does not do fast evict/restarts.  It is my understanding that this specific and narrowly-defined use case meets an existing user need, and if that is so, we'll get it for basically free in the process of doing vm-assisted checkpointing.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-May-15 16:38:41 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nUse V8_1-gittrac_4297-branch for follow-ups until V8_1-vc-branch is close to production.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-May-19 16:51:28 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nTannenbaum points out that requirement (b) is tough if the application stores state on-disk during normal operation, because the on-disk state will diverge from the stored state of the checkpoint.

This may require some hacking (since condor_ckpt_probe doesn't report the whole checkpoint platform string).

He noticed two issues.\n\n<p>First, the standard out (and presumably, error) files we return to the user only include output (or error) since the most recent checkpoint (restart).  This is at best disconcerting, and certainly counter to expectations; and it should be a relatively simple fix.\n\n</p><p>Second, after a condor_vacate_job, we report an explicitly application-level checkpointing job as \"not checkpointed\", regardless of the actually success or failure of the checkpoint.  This was at least in part to avoid accidentally triggering any standard universe -specific code, but it's deceptive and should be fixed (at a lower priority than the first, because it could get complicated).\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Mar-11 17:47:30 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nConsider, even if this feature goes in as experimental, modifying condor_submit to know about <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=WantCheckpointSignal\" title=\"Want Checkpoint Signal\">WantCheckpointSignal</a></span>.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Mar-13 10:09:36 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nMarked as experimental until we're sure we want people to be trying to use it without support for any kind of checkpoint server at all.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Mar-13 10:14:21 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nAdded concatenation of output and error streams across runs.
