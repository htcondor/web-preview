{"id": 4674, "title": "Ticket #4674: Allow sub-collector queries", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen working with a collector tree (esp. in the glideinWMS case), we often don't forward Master classads from parent to child due to the lack of memory.\n\n<p>If you want to \"condor_off\" a glidein, you have to write a for-loop to iterate across all the child collectors, find the master ad, and then issue the condor_off.\n\n</p><p>I propose we extend the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CollectorList\" title=\"Collector List\">CollectorList</a></span> class to first query the pool collector for known child collectors, then issue the query to each returned child collector (in order).\n\n</p><p>The child collectors selected will be controlled by COLLECTOR_QUERY_EXPR; if set to false (default), the parent collector is queried directly.  If, for example, this is set to \"true\", all child collectors <strong>and the parent</strong> are queried; the parent is queried because it advertises itself.\n\n</p><p>Similarly to how \"condor_q -g\" works, I propose the following error semantics: if there's at least one child collector that returns successfully, the whole operation is marked as a success.  Otherwise, the operation fails.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Oct-23 21:18</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/245f87a97cfb9e729fffe2dacd7107fe19ac3229\">[41435]</a></span>: Allow sub-collector queries. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4674\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4674'); return false;\" title=\"Allow sub-collector queries\">#4674</a></span> This functionality, inspired by \"condor_q -g\", allows the condor_status (and anything else used by <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CollectorList\" title=\"Collector List\">CollectorList</a></span>) to first query the collector for a list of child collectors, then performs the query sequentially against the child collectors.\u00a0[...]\n (By Brian Bockelman )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Oct-23 21:30", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Oct-23 21:30", "fixed_version": "2014-Oct-23 21:30", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "bbockelm", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
