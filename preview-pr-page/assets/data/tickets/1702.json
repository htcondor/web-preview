{"id": 1702, "title": "Ticket #1702: improve information about remote held globus jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen jobs go on hold at a gt2 site (and gt5, I believe), the status of the job in the condor-g queue remains \"running\".  It is common for users to wait for days, wondering why their jobs are running for so long.  It would be nice if at least the globus state was made to be \"suspended\".  It would be even nicer if the hold reason could be propagated somehow.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:50:47 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:20:02 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:20", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Oct-08 15:08", "fixed_version": "2010-Oct-08 15:08", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
