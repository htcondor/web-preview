{"id": 659, "title": "Ticket #659: Add a log reader file descriptor throttle to DAGMan", "description": "<blockquote>\nNote: I was manually running a large DAG test with a 20,000 x 5 node DAG, and this failed because of running out of file descriptors when it went into recovery mode.\n\n<p>What I have in mind is that there would be some way to tell the lazy log file code to only have n file descriptors open at any given time, and it would open and close files as necessary to maintain that.  One simple (but non-optimal) way to reduce the FD use in a DAG with lots of parallel nodes would be to just open and close each log file each time we look at it.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Aug-10 13:35:32 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nIt's better to have a limit. Open and close on each event/read is a performance killer. It is currently making the EVENT_LOG quite slow.\n\n<p>Can the immediate problem of the large dag test be changed to use fewer log files?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Aug-10 13:59:57 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThe problem is not really that I got the large DAG test to fail -- the\nproblem is that a real user might conceivable generate a DAG that would\nrequire a similar number of log files to be read.\n\n<p>I don't think this is real urgent, because we're at least no worse off with the new \"lazy log file\" code than with the old code.  But if a user has a very \"wide\" DAG, it's still possible for DAGMan to really have a lot of log files open at the same time.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-14 11:28:51 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI've marked this ticket as active, and assigned it to Pete, because Filip Krikava is working on this, and Pete is the one who's working most closely with him.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-30 11:00:47 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nWe have Filip's final patch, but Kent, Cathrin, and I haven't had time to tweak it the final ways it needs tweaking and put it into the codebase.

Several have failed so far -- I'll post a list once I'm done.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-13 15:18:47 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI just manually ran the existing tests with the FD throttle code, and the following tests failed:\n\n<p></p><pre>  job_dagman_jobstate_log\n  job_dagman_noop_node\n  job_dagman_prepost\n  job_dagman_rescue-A\n  job_dagman_rescue_recov\n  job_dagman_splice-P.run\n  job_dagman_subdag_in_splice-A\n</pre>\n\n<p>So we have some work to do...\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-14 11:05:30 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nAll of the failed tests except the splice-P test are getting the same error:\n\n<p></p><pre>  04/14/11 10:30:20 Currently monitoring 1 Condor log file(s)\n  04/14/11 10:30:20 lock_file returning ERROR, errno=9 (Bad file descriptor)\n  04/14/11 10:30:20 FileLock::obtain(1) failed - errno 9 (Bad file descriptor)\n  04/14/11 10:30:20 ERROR \"Assertion ERROR on (m_lock-&gt;isLocked())\" at line 1353 in file /scratch.1/wenger/condor_build/condor_git6/CONDOR_SRC/src/condor_utils/read_user_log.cpp\n</pre>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-14 13:15:51 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm, I'm digging around in the log file code right now, and given what I'm seeing we'll need to specifically test this on Windows, and with old-style file locking, because there are different code paths for those cases.  (Once we actually get it working in the \"normal\" case...)\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-14 14:54:06 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, the failures of the existing tests seem to be a conflict between the FD throttling code and the \"new\" file locking code.  (If I set ENABLE_USERLOG_LOCKING to false, the tests succeed.)\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-15 11:15:16 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nNathan re-did the patch yesterday and fixed some problems with how it was applied.

In the end, you still must poll the files because inotify is not infallible.  It's just pretty dang good.\n\n</p><p>In terms of the number of file descriptors, inotify is going to use one file descriptor per instance, but you have to manage something else called \"watch descriptors\".  These still are going to take up memory (kernel and application side), but aren't counted against your fd limit.\n\n</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't offer any insights into the equivalent entities in Windows.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jan-31 12:11:18 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nI am pretty sure you mean to \"increase\" the polling interval, so as to \"decrease\" the frequency of polling.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-May-22 14:29:52 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nI am told this is to be addressed by <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2807\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2807'); return false;\" title=\"Have DAGMan use a single node job user log file\">#2807</a></span>.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Sep-04 14:57:46 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nThis ticket ticket is dead.
