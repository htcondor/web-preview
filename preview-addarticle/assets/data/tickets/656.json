{"id": 656, "title": "Ticket #656: Run cross tests using RHEL4 Condor binaries on all Linux platforms.", "description": "<blockquote>\nNearly half of the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=BatLab\" title=\"Bat Lab\">BatLab</a></span> platforms run RHEL3 Condor binaries.  The Condor cross tests do not target any platforms for RHEL4 Condor binaries.  Please submit a cross test run using RHEL4 Condor binaries of the appropriate architecture to all <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=BatLab\" title=\"Bat Lab\">BatLab</a></span> Linux platforms.  The results will assist us in determining the platforms we can possibly continue to support when RHEL3 Condor binaries are no longer available.\n\n<p>Thanks!\n\n</p><p>-Becky</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Sep-04 10:59:15 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nTurns out we are not going to pursue this route.\n\n<p>Instead, for the Batlab we are thinking of making building clipped Condor very portable (it is mostly there already), and doing a native clipped Condor build on all the different platforms.
