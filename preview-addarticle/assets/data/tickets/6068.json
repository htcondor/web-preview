The transfer fails if it can't connect the shadow. The transfer stats are then sent over the dead syscall socket, which blows an ASSERT.\n\n<p>If the JICShadow object knows it's disconnected from the shadow, it shouldn't even try to do the transfer when requested. It should indicate a transient failure, so that the transfer will be retried if the shadow reconnects.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Jan-17 15:42:37 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong>  Looks good</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2016-Dec-22 10:50</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/28b8519e319cf6abd9816967fcac4f03b8bc64fb\">[49869]</a></span>: Don't attempt file transfer when disconnected from shadow. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6068\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6068'); return false;\" title=\"File Transfer Stats crash starter when disconnected\">#6068</a></span> Instead, the JICShadow object should return a transient failure, resulting in the transfer being retried after a reconnect.
