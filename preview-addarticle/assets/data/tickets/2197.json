{"id": 2197, "title": "Ticket #2197: General statistics architecture for Condor", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe would like to be able to gather statistics for the purpose of improving the\nCondor software and providing guidance to users. The data is to give us insight\nin to what the daemon is doing, and in particular intended to help us determine\nthe reasons for badput.\n\n<p><span class=\"subsection\"></span></p><h3>General Guidelines:</h3>\n\n<p>We will do the bare minimum of processing of data.  The onus of processing will\nbe on the user. Thus the data we collect will observe the following constraints.\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>Instantaneous values or totals from the time the daemon was started will be published.\n</li><li>Statistical data is not persistent and will be lost when the daemon process exits.\n</li><li>The set of statistical values is defined at compile time, based on actual\n  user requests or plausable use cases. Dynamic or user-defined statistics are\n  not envisaged.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Calls to increment and update raw statistical values will need to be added in various places in the code that we are trying to measure, but an effort should be made to minimize the amount of code needed outside of the statistics module.\n\n</p><p>It will be straightforward to change or add new statistical values, and to change which <span class=\"quote\">ClassAds</span> statistics are published into.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"subsection\"></span></p><h3>Implementation: </h3>\n\n<p>A module will be created to aid in the storage, updating and publishing of statistics. Storage of temporary values and much of the code for windowing and calculating statistical data will be collected into a class or set of classes.  The class will have a simple interface for callers to increment various counters, and to publish the collected values.\n\n</p><p>There will be three main types of statistical values\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>Simple values or time durations that will increase throughout the lifetime of the daemon\n</li><li>Windowed values for the most recent <span class=\"quote\">RecentStatWindowTime</span> seconds\n</li><li>Histograms returned as a list of values\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>In most cases statistical values will be available as both Simple values and Recent window values.\n\n</p><p>The statistics will be collected internally in the daemons, and published in\nthe daemons' <span class=\"quote\">ClassAds</span>. The collection will occur in a statically allocated table, with the exception of the binning for the lists (e.g., in <span class=\"quote\">JobLifetimes</span>). The binning is envisaged to be a config knob.\n\n</p><p>The initial implementation will define what statistics exist and where they will be published at compile time.  But it is expected that we may want to make changes at run-time in the future, so care will be taken to not preclude that.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"strike\">\n<strike>Because the changes #2006 have already been shipped by Red Hat, we will make it easy to publish some of the values under the names indicated in #2006 as well as under the names given above.

What is the expected payoff for a generic cross-daemon 'stats collecting' object and/or service?\n\n<p>As part of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2006\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2006'); return false;\" title=\"RFE: publish some additional performance-related stats in schedd ad\">#2006</a></span> I implemented a template widget called timed_queue&lt;&gt; which can be limited by either a time-window or a particular size (or both) -- it provides ring-buffer functionality.  It also demonstrates some basic accumulation methods:\n\n</p><p>.../src/condor_utils/timed_queue.h\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-May-31 14:54:48 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nPayoff from having cross-daemon object/service is that it is something that the schedd does not have to do; It seems that the schedd is getting overloaded, and not adding more to it seems like a good idea.  Also, such a service could communicate with the collector and negotiator, rather than being part of the schedd.\n\n<p>As it is, the timed_queue has got two objections that I have heard here around UW: first, it is not a priori bounded in memory usage; second, there is an objection to deriving from std::deque, because condor is not set up now to handle C++ exceptions very well.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-May-31 17:31:32 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nRegarding timed_queue&lt;&gt; questions:\n\n<p>1) It's memory can be bounded in a well defined way using the max_len() method, if desired.\n\n</p><p>2) Regarding exceptions, the STL data structures that are used in the condor code already include string, vector&lt;&gt; and map&lt;&gt;.   Adding deque&lt;&gt; to that list doesn't introduce a qualitative change.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-May-31 17:39:31 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nRegarding schedd computational load, it doesn't feel obvious to me that updating a given statistic is more compute-expensive than executing the machinery of sending data to a third party so the third party can maintain it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 12:04:26 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nYes, STL has snuck into Condor, for better or worse.  Hopefully, the upside is better than the downside.\n\n<p>I do not know that the statistics daemon is a good idea; I am just throwing it out there.  I could see some lunatic asking for statistics 30 times/sec and then it would probably make sense to offload it from the schedd.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 12:18:21 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nI think we need to create some clear objectives &amp; requirements, based on use cases, similar to some of the other tickets.  It might become more obvious what the best path will be then.  As it stands, this is pretty nebulous, and prone to conjecture atm.  It might be worth a mtg with some folks to gather/define requirements.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 12:19:06 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nAmen\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-03 10:20:39 by bcotton:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom our Research Services group, who do the statistical finagling:\n\n<p>There are three distinct types of things that we cannot (to our\nknowledge) get from Condor right now that would be very helpful:\n\n</p><p>1.  Full job run attempt history.\nRight now, all that is logged in the history log is the last,\nsecond-to-last, and some info about the first run attempted.\nA lot of the discussion and proposal seems to be centered around\nthe notion of reporting statistics on a job.  We don't want or\nneed Condor to do statistics--we have real statistics packages\nfor that.  What we would like is for Condor to log the raw data\nthose need about <em>every</em> attempted run.\n\n</p><p>2.  Information on jobs in progress or in queue.\nRight now, history only logs anything about a job after it\ncompletes.  This is very problematic.  It would be much more\nuseful to get information about jobs before they complete, as\nthings happen.  This really is a fundamental shift in thinking\nabout logging, from a job-based log to an event-based log.\nEven if something wholly different from the current history\nlog, a real event-based log would be far more useful.  Many\njobs will stay in progress for days or even weeks, and not\nbeing able to report on them until they finish makes truly\naccurate reporting on the current state of the system simply\nimpossible.\n\n</p><p>3.  Centralized logging.\nBeing reliant on access to logs from the schedd hosts is a\nreally big problem.  It means that we cannot get accurate\ninformation on what our pool resources are doing if any of\nthem allow jobs from hosts outside of our control, either\ndirectly or through flocking.  This creates a huge disincentive\nfor anyone to allow any jobs from outside of their own\norganization, because they have no way of tracking what work\nor even how much work they are supporting by those outside\nschedds.  Note, this doesn't have to be a fancy DB-based\ncustom system.  Simply having event-based remote syslog\nsupport would solve all of (1), (2), and (3) above.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-03 10:36:52 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nbcotton - love the comments! and there may be 2-3 side-tickets just from that!\n\n<p>But I'm not sure it relates <strong>100%</strong> to the root of this specific ticket.
