It does try to delete the job's execute directory, but doesn't invoke the glexec code path. As a result, the starter orphans both the job (true for all job types when the lease expires) and the sandbox.\n\n<p>The startd acts as a back-stop for cleaning up resources orphaned by the starter. But it doesn't know how to invoke glexec to do proper cleanup. For the job process family, the procd does know how to use glexec to kill it. But the procd purges that knowledge when the starter exits, since the starter is the watcher of that process family.\n\n</p><p>As a fix for the immediate problem that's suitable for the stable series, I plan to fix the starter to start a fast shutdown when the job lease expires. This will hit the normal code paths for quickly killing the job and cleaning up after it.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Jan-20 16:35:03 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>Looks good.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Jan-20 11:33</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/e8dbad4b315029c4b91c5780a178c8de8726731a\">[50025]</a></span>: Docs for glexec job cleanup bug fix. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6058\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6058'); return false;\" title=\"condor_starter abandons glexec job on shadow disconnect\">#6058</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2016-Dec-24 06:54</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f7c40197c78d7735383e01334f37cf4aefeb7a39\">[49877]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6058\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6058'); return false;\" title=\"condor_starter abandons glexec job on shadow disconnect\">#6058</a></span>) Fixup build, glexec not supported on Windows  (By Tim Theisen )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2016-Dec-22 09:19</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/95102fae4541405f7e3571fa74c621ed6b220f8b\">[49863]</a></span>: Fix cleanup of glexec jobs on lease expiration in the starter. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6058\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6058'); return false;\" title=\"condor_starter abandons glexec job on shadow disconnect\">#6058</a></span> When removing the job's execute directory, chown it back to the condor user if that hasn't been done already.
