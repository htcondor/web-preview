{"id": 7324, "title": "Ticket #7324: Make job event log parser less fragile", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7191\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7191'); return false;\" title=\"Clarify job event log number 009 text\">#7191</a></span>, we changed the message that follows the event log type number, job id, and timestamp for one of the event types. This change is backwards-compatible (later versions of the reader can read earlier versions) but not forwards-compatible (earlier version of the reader cannot read later versions).\n\n<p>This kind of change is frustrating. It would be nice if the reader itself was less fragile to these kinds of changes. In particular, it would be nice to always get the event number, job id, and timestamp out, even if the rest of the message can't be parsed as expected.\n\n</p><p>This is hard right now, but should become easier in the future if event parsing becomes lazy. So, defer until that happens.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Oct-14 12:20", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Oct-14 12:20", "fixed_version": "2019-Oct-14 12:20", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#7191", "creator": "karpel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "karpel@wisc.edu tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
