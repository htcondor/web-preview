{"id": 4059, "title": "Ticket #4059: DAG-level NOOP jobs shouldn't need submit file if using workflow log", "description": "<blockquote>\nI believe that DAG-level NOOP jobs will fail if the specified submit file doesn't exist.  If you're using the default/workflow log file, I don't think that should be the case, because I think the only reason we needed a submit file was to know what log file to write the fake events to.\n\n<p>I guess step 1 is to verify that a missing submit file really <strong>will</strong> cause the DAG to fail; if that's the case, step 2 would be to fix it.\n\n</p><p>Also see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3843\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3843'); return false;\" title=\"DAGMan:  don't look for log file names in submit files\">#3843</a></span>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-May-17 10:19:39 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThis isn't true (at least, not anymore), so I'm going to mark this ticket as abandoned.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-May-17 10:19", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2013-Nov-12 13:12", "fixed_version": "2013-Nov-12 13:12", "broken_version": "v080004", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
