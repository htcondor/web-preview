So each job changed involves a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GetAttribute\" title=\"Get Attribute\">GetAttribute</a></span> call and a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SetAttribute\" title=\"Set Attribute\">SetAttribute</a></span> call,  with a constraint, that's at least 2 round trips to the schedd for each job touched.\n\n<p>This how  condor_prio works now when you specify a username.  but I'm assuming that no-one ever does that because what would be the point?\n\n</p><p>So to actually do a constraint arg for condor_prio implies that we want to change the protocol, or have it modify the jobs using the same mechanism that Qedit uses.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-May-06 16:00", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Mar-27 17:23", "fixed_version": "2019-Mar-27 17:23", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tim", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
