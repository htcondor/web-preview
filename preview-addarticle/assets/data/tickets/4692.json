{"id": 4692, "title": "Ticket #4692: URL transfer plugin and should_transfer_files broken if input URL only", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf should_transfer_files is not set in the submit file, and transfer_input_files contains URLs, they are not transferred, which is highly unintuitive.\n\n<p>Also, when should_transfer_files = if_needed, URLs again need special treatment since they have nothing to do with whether or not the file system domain matches between submit and execute.\n\n</p><p>Full report from Brian Candler on condor-users:\n\n</p><p>(1) Running a personal condor (8.0.7), given the following submit file\n(foo.sub) with the input from a URL:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">universe = vanilla\nexecutable = /bin/sh\narguments = \"'-c' 'cat condor_submit.html'\"\ntransfer_executable = no\ntransfer_input_files =\nhttp://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/current/condor_submit.html\noutput = foo.out\nerror = foo.err\nqueue\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I find that the file is not transferred at all. foo.err says:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    cat: condor_submit.html: No such file or directory\n</pre>\n\n<p>The documentation says:\n\n</p><p>\"For vanilla and vm universe jobs only, a file may be specified by\ngiving a URL, instead of a file name. The implementation for URL\ntransfers requires both configuration and available plug-in.\"\n\n</p><p>but these are indeed present (/etc/condor/condor_config has\nFILETRANSFER_PLUGINS which includes /usr/lib/condor/libexec/curl_plugin)\n\n</p><p>WORKAROUND: I was able to make it work by setting \"should_transfer_files\n= yes\".\n\n</p><p>However, is this right? Surely a URL should always be fetched,\nregardless of whether or not you are in the same filesystem domain,\nsince URLs don't appear in the filesystem anyway?\n\n</p><p>(2) Given a unimplemented URL scheme (like \"https\"), I found a\ndifference between my test personal condor node and my production condor\nnode. The former would leave the job idle because of a classAd matching\ncondition which was never true:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    1   ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer &amp;&amp;\nstringListMember(\"https\",HasFileTransferPluginMethods) )\n</pre>\n\n<p>but the latter puts the job into a \"held\" (H) state, saying\n\n</p><p>Hold reason: Error from slot1@dar2.example.net: STARTER at 192.168.6.42\nfailed to receive file /var/lib/condor/execute/dir_24716/xxxx.xxxx:\nFILETRANSFER:1:FILETRANSFER: plugin for type https not found!\n\n</p><p>(Aside: if a plugin for https is not present, wouldn't it be better to\nabort the job rather than put it into a 'held' state indefinitely, as\nthis isn't a condition which is likely to fix itself?)\n\n</p><p>Anyway, I managed to drill down to find the difference, and it turns out\nto be different behaviour depending on whether you set\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    should_transfer_files = if_needed\n</pre>\n\n<p>or\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    should_transfer_files = yes\n</pre>\n\n<p>I cannot find this behaviour documented anywhere.

This implies to me that if the machines\nare in different filesystem domains this should behave the same as\n\"should_transfer_files = yes\", but actually the generated requirements\nexpressions are different in these two cases.\n\n</p><p>You can reproduce it with the following test case:\n\n</p><p><code>---- bar.sub ----</code>\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">universe = vanilla\nexecutable = /bin/sh\narguments = \"-c true\"\ntransfer_executable = no\ntransfer_input_files = https://example.net/\nshould_transfer_files = if_needed\n#should_transfer_files = yes\nerror = bar.err\nrequirements = ( TARGET.Machine == \"nonexistent\" )\nqueue\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Submit with \"condor_submit bar.sub\" then use \"condor_q -analyze &lt;pid&gt;\"\n\n</p><p>[Results with should_transfer_files = if_needed]\n\n</p><p>The Requirements expression for your job is:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    ( ( TARGET.Machine == \"nonexistent\" ) ) &amp;&amp; ( TARGET.Arch == \"X86_64\" ) &amp;&amp;\n    ( TARGET.OpSys == \"LINUX\" ) &amp;&amp; ( TARGET.Disk &gt;= RequestDisk ) &amp;&amp;\n    ( TARGET.Memory &gt;= RequestMemory ) &amp;&amp; ( ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer ) ||\n      ( TARGET.FileSystemDomain == MY.FileSystemDomain ) )\n</pre>\n\n<p>[Results with should_transfer_files = yes]\n\n</p><p>The Requirements expression for your job is:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    ( ( TARGET.Machine == \"nonexistent\" ) ) &amp;&amp; ( TARGET.Arch == \"X86_64\" ) &amp;&amp;\n    ( TARGET.OpSys == \"LINUX\" ) &amp;&amp; ( TARGET.Disk &gt;= RequestDisk ) &amp;&amp;\n    ( TARGET.Memory &gt;= RequestMemory ) &amp;&amp; ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer &amp;&amp;\n      stringListMember(\"https\",HasFileTransferPluginMethods) )\n</pre>\n\n<p>This to me also seems like a bug, as I was expecting\nshould_transfer_files = (yes|if_needed) to behave the same when the\nnodes are in different filesystem domains. But if it's not, I think it\nshould be documented accordingly.\n\n</p><p>To me the correct behaviour would be something like this:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>if any input or output file is a URL, then add\n<code>stringListMember(\"&lt;scheme&gt;\",HasFileTransferPluginMethods)</code> to the\nrequirements\n\n<p></p></li><li>if should_transfer_files = yes, then add <code>( TARGET.HasFileTransfer )</code>\n\n<p></p></li><li>if should_transfer_files = if_needed, then add\n<code>( ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer ) ||\n      ( TARGET.FileSystemDomain</code> == <code>MY.FileSystemDomain ) )</code></li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Aug-01 11:20:21 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThis just recently affected on of our CHTC users, as well.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Apr-13 16:53:32 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong>\n\n<p>Everything looks good.
