Changes for version 0.9.9: (released 15-June-2007)

* Fixed a crash when a ClassAd has more than one attribute and an
  attribute other than the first has an && with no second expression.

* ClassAds with multiple semicolons in a row used to cause a parse
  error because an empty expression was not allowed. They are now
  allowed.
