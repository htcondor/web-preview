{"id": 6528, "title": "Ticket #6528: Work to make it easier for the SWAMP  to detect stuck jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere are various bits of work that have been requested by the SWAMP to make it easier for them to detect stuck jobs and/or personal condors.\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>Make it so that a job cannot be submitted if it does not match any resource in the pool\n</li><li>condor_q should have a mode where it prints out jobs that will never match any resource\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>They are particularly concerned with the case where the VM universe of the startd goes offline because this would result in a stuck pool for them.\n\n</p><p>Item  1 above can be solved by appropriate use of SUBMIT_REQUIREMENT(s) configuration.  The trick there is to make it easy to generate the submit requirements.  This will be solved by adding an output mode to condor_status that is the effective SUBMIT_REQIREMENTS expressions to duplicate matchmaking to the aggregate STARTD ads.  This should be fairly straightforward, but if not we will try something else)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6527\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6527'); return false;\" title=\"turn a set of startd ads into SUBMIT_REQUIREMENTS statements\">#6527</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nturn a set of startd ads into SUBMIT_REQUIREMENTS statements</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6529\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6529'); return false;\" title=\"condor_q should have a mode showing idle jobs that will never match\">#6529</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\ncondor_q should have a mode showing idle jobs that will never match</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-Feb-26 13:51", "status": "resolved", "created": "2018-Jan-10 17:16", "fixed_version": "2018-Jan-10 17:16", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
