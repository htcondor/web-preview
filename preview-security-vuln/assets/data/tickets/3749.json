{"id": 3749, "title": "Ticket #3749: Use filesystem namespaces to present non-changing execute directory", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen USE_FS_NAMESPACES=TRUE, we should use filesystem namespaces to lie about the current working directory, presenting a constant, unchanging answer.  Perhaps /work, or perhaps the $(Iwd) (the CWD when the job was submitted)?\n\n<p>Rationale: some self-checkpointing software is ill behaved and encodes absolute paths in their checkpoints.  When they move, they get cranky.  Implementing this allows such software to Just Work.\n\n</p><p>$(Iwd) seems optimal becaue the job's environment looks more like the submit point.  If the job has hard coded paths to things in $(Iwd), it is more likely to Just Work.\n\n</p><p>Concrete example: <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3747\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3747'); return false;\" title=\"DMTCP checkpoints can't handle being moved\">#3747</a></span>: DMTCP checkpoints can't handle being moved</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jul-09 14:46", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jul-09 14:46", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-09 14:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
