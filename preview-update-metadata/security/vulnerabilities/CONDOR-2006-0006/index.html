  Since the user can spoof the identity of any user in the system except root,
  they can become any user and access any resources that are available to
  that user.  This includes the account used to run the condor components, that
  can then be used to disrupt operation of the Condor pool, including denial
  of service attacks and the integrity of existing jobs in the system.

    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  The FS and FS_REMOTE authentication methods depend upon the authenticating
  party being able to produce a file with a name given by the service requiring
  authentication.  The location of the file for the FS method is in the /tmp
  directory, and in the case of FS_REMOTE, it would be in a directory that is
  writable by a group or all users and is on a networked file system.
<p>  The problem is that the authentication algorithm depends on the ability to
  create a file in the directory that has the following attributes: owned by
  the authenticating user, is not a symbolic link, and has a link count of one
  (no hard links).  Unfortunately, there are several ways that a user can
  arrange to have a file with an arbitrary name appear in a directory to which
  they have write access.
<p>  The first way is when the directory is writable by the attacker, the
  directory does not have a sticky bit set (or the file system does not support
  the sticky bit behavior on directories, only the owner/root can rename or
  remove directory entries), and there exists a file owned by the spoofed user
  on the same file system that is also in a directory that is writable by the
  attacker.  In this case, the attacker can simply move the existing file to
  the desired name and after the authentication passes, the file can be moved
  back.
<p>  The second way, which works even in a directory that has the sticky bit set,
  requires that the directory is writable by the attacker and that spoofed user
  had created and deleted a file on the file system prior to the attack.  The
  prerequisites for this attack are commonly found in the /tmp directory on
  most UNIX systems.  The attack is possible because UNIX allows any user to
  create a hard link to any file in the system, even those that they do not
  own.  The attack can be implemented as follows:
<p>  <ol>
  <li>Create a directory ($FILE_STORE_DIR) on the same file system containing
      the shared directory ($SHARED_DIR) without the stick bit being set.</li>
  <li>Wait for spoofed user to create a file ($USER_TEMP_FILE) in shared
      directory.</li>
  <li>Create a hard link to $USER_TEMP_FILE in the $FILE_STORE_DIR
      directory, with the path $USER_CAPTURED_FILE.</li>
  <li>Wait for user to delete the $USER_TEMP_FILE.  Now the attacker's
      $USER_CAPTURED_FILE is a file owned by the spoofed user with a link count
      of 1 in a directory without the sticky bit set.</li>
  <li>Start the modified client program requiring authentication using FS or
      FS_REMOTE, passing the spoofed user name as the user to authenticate.</li>
  <li>When the component requiring authentication requests the creation of
      the file, $AUTH_FILE_PATH, rename the $USER_CAPTURED_FILE to
      $AUTH_FILE_PATH</li>
  <li>The authentication algorithm will now succeed as all the checked
      properties are met.</li>
  </ol>

  The cause of this is the incorrect assumption that only the owner of a file
  is able to create the file with a link count of 1 in a shared directory.

<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  There are several possible mitigations to this vulnerability.  The first is
  to create a directory instead of a file for authentication.  This works as
  hard links to a directory are either not allowed or are only allowed by the
  root user.  In the case of directory or file system without the directory
  stick bit behavior this would not be sufficient.
<p>  This could be fixed by requiring the authenticatee to create the file with
  permissions so that only it could write to the file, and then have it write a
  secret given by the authenticator into the file, and finally having the
  authenticator read the secret out of the file.
<p>  Another solution would be for the authenticator, running as root to create a
  directory that has permissions, so that only the authenticating user can create
  a file in the directory.  Then have the authenticatee create the file in this
  directory.

<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  The vulnerability was fixed in the FS authentication method by creating a
  directory instead of a file.
<p>  REMOTE_FS should be more secure with this fix, but due to the inherent
  insecurity of some remote file systems designs and implementations REMOTE_FS
  is vulnerable through vulnerabilities in the remote file system and should
  not be used.
