<dd><p>We want to invite you to  <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2013/">HTCondor Week 2013</a> , our annual HTCondor user conference, in beautiful Madison, WI April 29-May 3, 2013. (HTCondor Week was formerly named Condor Week, matching  <a href="https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/htcondor-users/2012-October/msg00110.shtml">a name change for the software</a>.) We will again host HTCondor Week at the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, a state of the art facility for academic and private research specifically designed to foster private and public collaboration. It provides HTCondor Week attendees a compelling environment to attend tutorials and talks from HTCondor developers and users like you. It also provides many comfortable spaces for one-on-one or small group collaborations throughout the week. This year we continue our partnership with the Paradyn Tools Project, making this year Paradyn/HTCondor Week 2013. There will be a full slate of tutorials and talk for both HTCondor and Paradyn.  <p>Our current development series, 7.9, is well underway toward our upcoming production release. When you attend, you will learn how to take advantage of the latest features such as per-job PID namespaces, cgroup enforced resource limits, Python bindings, CPU affinity, BOSCO for submitting jobs to remote batch systems without administrator assistance, EC2 spot instance support, and a variety of speed and memory optimizations. You'll also get a peek into our longer term development plans--something you can only get at HTCondor Week!  <p>We will have a variety of in-depth tutorials, talks, and panels where you can not only learn more about HTCondor, but you can also learn how other people are using and deploying HTCondor. Best of all you can establish contacts and learn best practices from people in industry, government and academia who are using HTCondor to solve hard problems, many of which may be similar to those facing you.  <p>Speaking of learning from the community, we'd love to have you give a talk at HTCondor Week. Talks are 20 minutes long and are a great way share your ideas and get feedback from the community. If you have a compelling use of HTCondor you'd like to share, let Alan De Smet know (<a href="mailto:adesmet@cs.wisc.edu">adesmet@cs.wisc.edu</a>) and he'll help you out.  <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2013/speaker_info.html"> More information on speaking at HTCondor Week is available at the HTCondor Week web site.</a>  <p>You can register, get the hotel details and see the agenda overview on   <a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2013/">the HTCondor Week 2013 site</a>.

<dd><p>In order to resolve a lawsuit challenging the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s use of the “Condor” trademark, the University has agreed to begin referring to its Condor software as “HTCondor” (pronounced “aitch-tee-condor”).  The letters at the start of the new name (“HT”) derive from the software’s primary objective: to enable high throughput computing, often abbreviated as HTC.  Starting in the end of October and through November of this year, you will begin to see this change reflected on our web site, documentation, web URLs, email lists, and wiki. While the name of the software is changing, nothing about the naming or usage of the command-line tools, APIs, environment variables, or source code will change. Portals, procedures, scripts, gateways, and other code built on top of the Condor software should not have to change at all when HTCondor is installed.</p>

This release of Condor now dynamically links the executables to the system security libraries, including openssl.  In the past, these libraries have been statically linked into the binaries.  As a result, system security updates will immediately benefit Condor.  The downside is that binaries built for a given platform may not be as portable to other platforms as in the past.  We have also seen a very rare, intermittent problem with DAGMan where the DAGMan program will ignore a successful job completion, and wait forever.

<dd><p>When Quill was first developed, it was designed to work with older versions of the PostgreSQL database server.  Newer versions of PostgreSQL have stronger security features, which can be enabled in the PostgreSQL configuration, requiring no changes to the Quill daemon.  We recommend that all Quill sites upgrade to the latest version of PostgreSQL (8.2), and make these easy changes to their PostgreSQL configuration.  The consequences of not doing so mean that any user who can sniff the network between the Quill daemon and the PostgreSQL server can obtain the Quill database password, and make changes to the Quill database.  This can change the output of condor_q and condor_history, but cannot otherwise impact Condor’s correctness or security.  Otherwise unauthorized users cannot use this database password to run jobs or mutate Condor’s configuration.  A second problem with the previously recommended configuration was that any user with the publicly-available read-only Quill PostgreSQL password could create new tables in the database and store information there. While this does not  effect the running of Condor in any way, sites may view that as a security problem.  As of Condor 6.8.6 and 6.9.4, the Condor manual has been updated to describe the more secure installation of PostgreSQL, which remedy both of the above problems.  These changes include the following:  Change the authentication method (the final field) in the pg_hba.conf file from “password” to “md5”.  Restarting PostgreSQL is then needed for this to take effect.  Only allow the quillwriter account to create tables.  To do this, run the following two SQL commands as the database owner.  REVOKE CREATE on SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;  GRANT CREATE on SCHEMA public to quillwriter;</p>

After a period of testing lasting over 6 months, the Department of Geography has successfully implemented a distributed computing system built upon the Condor platform.  Since its implementation, the Condor distributed computing network has provided a unique facility for spatial modelling which is particularly suited to Monte Carlo approaches. Thanks to the processing power offered by the Condor network, members of the Catchment, River and Hillslope Science (CRHS) group have developed methods of ultra-high resolution image processing and remote sensing which are pushing the traditional boundaries of ecological monitoring at both catchment and local scales.</p>

<dd><p>The Condor Team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 6.7.7.  6.7.7 is primarily for improvements to the grid universe.  It includes support for strong authentication and multiple users for the “condor” gridtype, and full support for the Globus Toolkit 4.0.0 release.  See the <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html"> Version History and Release Notes</a> for details. Condor 6.7.7 is available from our <a href="downloads/">Downloads</a> page.  We believe 6.7.7 is fairly stable, but it is not recommended for production systems, unless you require checkpointing support for a Linux distribution not supported by our 6.6 releases.  6.7.6 users who are using the Globus Toolkit 4.0 are strongly urged to upgrade to 6.7.7.</p>

<dt><a href="/web-preview/preview-test/news/Condor_Version_6.3.0_released!/">(March  1, 2001) <strong>Condor Version 6.3.0 released!</strong></a></dt>
<dd><p>Condor Version 6.3.0 has been released, and is available on the <a href="downloads/"> downloads</a> page. 6.3.0 is the first release in the 6.3 <i>development</i> series. Future 6.3 releases will contain many new features, primarily in the areas of MPI support, Globus support,  firewall support, an improved DAGMan, improved error handling / propagation, and bandwidth regulation.  For more info on our version-number system, please read <a href="version_number.html">this</a>. &lt;p&gt; The UNIX builds are now available on the website. The primary focus of 6.3.0 has been in preliminary support for MPI jobs on dedicated clusters of  machines. 6.3.0 is not as well-tested as 6.2.0, and undoubtedly contains a number of bugs. It should not be used by those requiring a tried and tested system; for that we recommend the 6.2 stable series.</p>
