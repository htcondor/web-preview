This directory is for MW's web presence.  HTCondor people have access
to it, as does Jeff Linderoth (linderot@msc.anl.gov), as he is one
of the people working on MW.  

The directory MW/ is a checkout of the MW workspace.  Keep it current!

The file MW.tar.gz is created by a simple 'tar cvf MW.tar MW/' command.
Keep this as current as the MW/ directory!

After checking out the MW files, do a 'make doc' in the main directory
and in the example-fib/ driectory.  We want the documentation current
as well....
