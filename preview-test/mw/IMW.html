<h2>
IMW:&nbsp;Interactive Master-Worker Style Parallel Data Analysis Tool on
the Grid</h2></center>

<center>by the Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin
- Madison
<br>04/16/2002</center>

<h2>
Motivation</h2>
The task of analyzing huge amount of data residing at different locations
can be greatly eased by the Grid. First, the analyzing tools can be executed
on machines close to the data, without incurring the cost of moving raw
data around; second, the computing and I/O&nbsp;resources provided by the
Grid can be utilized to perform the analysis task in parallel, which leads
much shorter experiment turn-around time; third, the various services provided
by the Grid infrastructure can simply to the job of managing distributed
resources. In order to fully exploit such opportunities, we are implementing
a framework to build interactive parallel data analysis tools on the Grid
- IMW.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Our Approach</h2>
Data analysis tasks lend themselves naturally to master-worker style parallel
processing, with its special requirements on user-interaction, visualization
and data locality support. Previously, we've developed a framework called
MW [1] to support master-worker style parallel applications on meta-computing
environments like HTCondor and Globus. It has been widely used and helped
solve some really hard computational problems [2]. MW&nbsp;has a layered
architecture to encapsulate the functionalities of underlying resource
manager and communication mechanisms, it also provides portability across
different underlying infrastructures. It exposes a set of simple APIs to
ease the application programmers' work.
<p>IMW&nbsp;is based on our experiences of developing MW, it has been rewritten
(mostly in Java) to
<ol>
<li>
add support of user interaction and computation steering;</li>

<li>
directly support data analyzing tasks, such as, histogram and parallel
execution of scripts;</li>

<li>
provide a lightweight Java implementation to ease porting and maintenance.</li>
</ol>
The current prototype divides the system into&nbsp; three different components:
<ol>
<li>
a client that interacts with human user and controls the analysis task;</li>

<li>
a master that manages the analysis task by decomposing the whole task into
smaller pieces and assign them to many workers in parallel;</li>

<li>
workers that get commands from the master and returns the result.</li>
</ol>
Different components communicate with each other using Socket. HTCondor,
as the resource manager, is used to gather worker hosts, spawn worker processes,
and report dynamic worker changes such as worker exit, suspension/resume,
etc. Fault-tolerance can be achieved by user-provided checkpoint functions,
to save partially completed result and recover after restart.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Status and Future Work</h2>
The bare-bone IMW&nbsp;prototype is working now, which can execute shell
scripts in parallel, and handles the worker dynamic changes. More work
needs to be done to add features and make it easy-to-use.
<p>After providing the basic functionality of parallel data analysis and
user interaction, we can also exploit two other tools developed at University
of Wisconsin.
<ol>
<li>
DEVise:&nbsp;DEVise is an environment for data exploration and visualization
written in, with flexible data selection and layout mechanisms. By using
DEVise as an visualization frontend, IMW's GUI&nbsp;development can be
greatly simplified, while it still provides customizable histogram support.</li>

<li>
ClassAds:&nbsp;Classads are used by HTCondor to describe resources and task
requirements. It would be a powerful tool for IMW&nbsp;to describe the
data category and analysis requirement, so that analyzing processes can
be directed and run on machines that exploit data locality and equipped
with sufficient resources.</li>
</ol>
