  In the rare configuration that CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY is set in the Condor
  configuration, arbitrary commands can be executed with the permissions of the
  condor_negotiator and condor_shadow's effective uid (normally the "condor"
  user).  This can result in a compromise of the condor configuration files,
  log files, and other files owned by the "condor" user.  This may also aid in
  attacks on other accounts.

  To exploit this vulnerability requires only the submission of a Condor job

  Normally, CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY is not defined, preventing this
  vulnerability.

  Usually, the condor_negotiator and condor_startd are configured to run as the
  "condor" user, and this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute
  arbitrary code as the "condor" user.
<p>  Since log files and other data files are owned by the "condor" user, they can
  be arbitrarily modified.  Also if the condor_negotiator is started as condor,
  the condor_negotiator can be attacked and the condor_negotiator is central to
  the operation of a Condor system.
<p>  Depending on the configuration, further more serious attacks may be possible.
  If the configuration files of the Condor system are writable by condor and
  the condor_master is run with root privileges, then root access can be
  gained.  If the condor binaries are owned by the "condor" user, these
  executables could be replaced, and when restarted, arbitrary code could be
  executed as the "condor" user. This also would allow root access as most condor
  daemons are started with an effective uid of root.

  The classad mechanism allows a site to configure a directory of external
  scripts using the CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY variable.  If this is set, then
  expressions containing terms of the following form <code>script("arg0",
  "arg1", "argN")</code>, will end up making a call to popen, using the first
  argument combined with the CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY value to form the name
  of a script and the remaining arguments are passed to the script with strings
  surrounded by double quotes.
<p>  Other than strings being surrounded with double quotes, the arguments are not
  escaped and quoted, or checked for shell metacharacters.  The library call of
  <code>popen($command)</code> does the equivalent of:
<p>	<code>/bin/sh -c "$command"</code>
<p>  With stdin or stdout of the command rerouted to the file descriptor returned by
  popen.  If CLASSAD_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY had the value "/condor/scripts", and
  the term were <code>script("myscript", "\";evil_command\"")</code>, the resulting
  operation would be equivalent to:
<p>	<code>/bin/sh -c '/condor/scripts/myscript "";evil_command""'</code>
<p>  Other methods of attack are also possible, including backquotes and other
  shell metacharacters that still have special meaning inside of double quotes.
<p>  A similar attack can be done on Windows using the '&amp;' metacharacter
  instead of the ';' metacharacter.

    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  User supplied data to the popen library call should be placed in single
  quotes to avoid misinterpretation of the command to be executed.  Single
  quotes should be placed around each argument and the script name sent to
  popen as they prevent the interpretation of most shell metacharacters.  The
  value placed in single quotes also needs to have any single quotes escaped by
  replacing them with '\'' (this closes the single quote, inserts a \-quoted
  single quote and reopens the single quote).  In the the example above, the
  command to be executed would become:
<p>	<code>'/condor/scripts/myscript' '";evil_command"'</code>
<p>  This will call the script with a single argument that happens to contain
  2 double quotes and a semicolon, and will not result in a vulnerability.
<p>  A better solution would be to replace the call to popen with a routine that
  mimics popen, but allows the arguments to be passed as a vector containing
  one entry for the executable and one for each argument individually, so the
  use of /bin/sh is not required.  This can be done with a pipe, fork, and execv
  or execve system calls so the calling environment and argument interpretation
  can be better controlled.  This would eliminate the need to deal with quoting
  at all.
