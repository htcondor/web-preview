Usually,when users run condor_history, they are looking for recent jobs, so -backwards prints what they are looking for faster.  We've never made any guarantees about ordering in the history file, so we will now add a -forward option, and make -backward the default.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Mar-28 12:24", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Mar-28 12:14", "fixed_version": "2012-Mar-28 12:14", "broken_version": "v070700", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": "20120328"}
