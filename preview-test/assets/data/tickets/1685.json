{"id": 1685, "title": "Ticket #1685: no documentation of specification of expression for -constraint option", "description": "<blockquote>\nOn 8-11-2010, a condor-users post expresses frustration in generating a correct expression for use with <strong>condor_status -constraint</strong>.  There are many references in the manual to <strong>condor_status</strong>, and a few to the section on <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>, but none explains the usage of single quote vs. double quote, and when backslashes might be appropriate as escape characters.  More explanation and more examples within the condor_status manual page will help.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Sep-30 10:15:32 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom Greg T:\nFor most (all?) Unix shells, the single quote mark (') is a way to cause the command-line interpretation to not expand anything within single quote marks. Therefore, it becomes the right way to delimit a single expression that has white space characters which would otherwise cause the expression to be broken into multiple command-line arguments.\n\n<p>From TJ:\nNot so on Windows machines (old, normal command shell).  A single quote mark would be passed through for the Condor tool to deal with.  So, double quote marks are the right way on Windows to delimit a single expression with white space characters.  Further gotcha is that an embedded (and needed) double quote mark must be escaped on Windows by using 2 consecutive double quote marks (\"\"), whereas a Unix escape would be a backslash followed by a double quote mark (\\\").\n\n</p><p>Conclusion:  virtually all our examples with the manual are Unix-specific.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Sep-30 12:45</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/67123b68ae88a194b5a4d580ebc21dfcbf38c27f\">[25710]</a></span>: improvements to describe -constraint expr, especially clarifying Unix vs Windows and providing examples of both; gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1685\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1685'); return false;\" title=\"no documentation of specification of expression for -constraint option\">#1685</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2010-Sep-30 12:49", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Sep-29 15:55", "fixed_version": "2010-Sep-29 15:55", "broken_version": "v070404", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
