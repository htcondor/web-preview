The change in behavior came out of the switch to ipv6 code.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-27 12:31:24 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nDoing <code>condor_status chevre</code> results in the following query going to the collector (note the blank Name and Machine constraints):\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">Projection = \"Name Machine Opsys Arch State Activity LoadAvg Memory ActvtyTime MyCurrentTime EnteredCurrentActivity\"\nMyType = \"Query\"\nTargetType = \"Machine\"\nCurrentTime = time()\nRequirements = ( ( ( Name == \"\" ) || ( Machine == \"\" ) ) )\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>But try it with <code>condor_status chevre.foo.edu</code>, that is the name is fully-qualified (i.e. it has a period character in it), then a proper query is sent:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">Projection = \"Name Machine Opsys Arch State Activity LoadAvg Memory ActvtyTime MyCurrentTime EnteredCurrentActivity\"\nMyType = \"Query\"\nTargetType = \"Machine\"\nCurrentTime = time()\nRequirements = ( ( ( Name == \"chevre.foo.edu\" ) || ( Machine == \"chevre.foo.edu\" ) )\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>To make an active connection, the only directory service consulted should be the collector.  Kinda looks like the daemon locate method is using DNS to try and convert a short name into a fully-qualified name before sending a query to the collector - I would love to see this crazy behavior from the dawn of Condor go away.\n\n</p><p>The behavior in HTCondor of the daemon locate method making any calls at all into DNS is, imo, broken design. Instead of leaning on DNS to go from short to fqhn (full qualified host name), why not just send a query to the collector that is appropriate if given a short name?  I.e. a query that uses regular expressions to strip out the short name from <code>Name</code> and <code>Machine</code> if the locate method is only given a short name.\n\n</p><p>I realize the above may be more appropriate for the dev series, and we still need something in the stable series... but I would hate to see DNS used even in v8.0.x....  Thoughts?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-01 08:07:27 by jrt:</em> <br/>\n\nWe also saw the same behavior with condor_config_val.

However, that may constitute new behavior and thus be better suited for 8.1.\n\n<p>If we don't want the \"right\" answer in 8.0, this approach seems broadly reasonable... but, it may not fix the case TJ mentions (that will require a proper code review).  And it needs a review.\n\n</p><p>I can review, but it's not happening until the week of the 19th <em>at the earliest</em>, and it may be later as I have a backlog of priority interrupts.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-22 16:02:39 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis patch restores the functionality of the old get_full_hostname() and get_full_hostname_from_hostent() (before Min's ipv6 code went in). We should be checking h_name before h_aliases in the hostent struct.\n\n<p>get_fqdn_and_ip_from_hostname() and get_hostname_with_alias() are similarly broken.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-22 16:22:59 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nOn closer inspection, it appears get_hostname_with_alias() is ok as-is.

Calling it with a short hostname can in some cases return only the short hostname. In these cases, it appears that gethostbyname and subsequent alias check will fail too because there is no FQDN alias. So, get_fqdn_from_hostname will fail on a known hostname. However, it appears that in these cases, the hostent from the gethostbyname call will have the FQDN in it's h_name.\n\n<p>Unsure of exact case where this happens.
