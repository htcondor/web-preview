   OUT OF DATE
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  This document is out of date. It describes how things were done in the configure/imake work.  In the cmake world things are different.  I've done some work to update it (2011-8-28), but there are almost certainly errors.

 <h2>
  Adding a new external package to HTCondor
 </h2>
 <p>
  This document describes how to add a new external package to the
HTCondor build.  There are a number of elements to this task which are
described below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Packaging the external so it can be built by the build system
   <ul>
    <li>
     Setting up the source tarball
    </li>
    <li>
     Putting the source tarball on the web server
    </li>
    <li>
     Making the build script
     <ul>
      <li>
       Build script environment
      </li>
      <li>
       Build script syntax
      </li>
      <li>
       Build script exit codes
      </li>
      <li>
       Build script example
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Handling patches (optional)
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Telling the build system about the new package
   <ul>
    <li>
     Telling CMake about your package
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Dealing with externals caches
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Before getting into the specifics, here's the 10,000 foot view of
how the HTCondor build system deals with externals:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The actual source tarball is hosted on a public web server.
  </li>
  <li>
   cmake decides which externals we need. The version is part of the cmake information for the branch.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a class="file" href="rlog?f=build/cmake/CondorConfigure.cmake">
    /build/cmake/CondorConfigure.cmake
   </a>
   looks for the external-specific CMakeLists.txt
  </li>
  <li>
   The individual external CMakeLists.txt describe how to download, patch, and build the external.
  </li>
  <li>
   Externals are built and stored in /scratch/condor-externals; you can change this default location with something like -DEXTERNAL_STAGE:PATH=/path/to/a/private/directory when you invoke cmake.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Understanding the above overview will help make sense of the
specific steps needed for modifying the build system to know about and
use a new external.
 </p>
 <p>
  In general, the process of adding a new version of an existing
external is very similar to if you're adding a whole new external.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <span class="section">
  <h2>
   Naming schemes and conventions
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  Before we get into the nuts and bolts, there are a few naming
conventions that need to be defined and clarified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each external package is identified by 2 things:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Name
   </strong>
   (e.g. "globus" or "krb5")
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Version
   </strong>
   (e.g. "1.2.7")
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These two parts of the package identification are important in
numerous places, and it's important to keep it all straight.  For the
rest of this document anywhere you see:
  <code>
   [name]
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   [version]
  </code>
  , you should substitute the right thing based on the
package you're adding.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding the name: it should be descriptive, but not too
long/verbose.  "z" is not good.  "zlib-compression-library" isn't
either.  usually it's pretty obvious.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding the version: ideally, this should be the official version
number of the external package as decided by its authors.  If we patch
a given external, that doesn't change the official version we're
basing the package on, and that's what the version number should be.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   However, if you want to add new patches to an existing external,
you should change the version number and add a new external!  We do
NOT want to have multiple things which are different code to be using
the same version!
  </strong>
  If differt versions share the same name,
externals caching may lead to builds using the wrong patches.
 </p>
 <p>
  When adding new patches to an existing external, add a
  <code>
   -p1
  </code>
  to the
  <code>
   [version]
  </code>
  to get your new version. If the
  <code>
   [version]
  </code>
  already ends in
  <code>
   -p&lt;number&gt;
  </code>
  , increment the number for your new version.
 </p>
 <p>
  You should continue to use the original tarball (with it's original
name).
  <strong>
   At the moment this is not possible
  </strong>
  , as the CMakeLists for most
(all?) of the externals assume that the tarball name, the directory
name inside of the tarball, and the version are identical.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have any questions or are uncertain, just ask.  Good people to ask are
  <strong>
   TODO
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the combination of
  <code>
   [name]-[version]
  </code>
  is often
referred to in the build system (and this document) as the
  <strong>
   package
name
  </strong>
  , and you'll see it listed as
  <code>
   [package-name]
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>

  <h2>
   Packaging the external so it can be built by the build system
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  Each external package used to build HTCondor lives in a unique
directory as part of the
  <code>
   externals
  </code>
  directory tree.  The basic
directory layout of
  <code>
   externals
  </code>
  is as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">externals/
         /bundles/
                 /[name]/
                        /[version]
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  The
  <code>
   bundles
  </code>
  directory contains subdirectories for each
kind of package, and each package directory has a subdirectory for
the version of that package.  Some packages may have multiple versions
because different operating systems require different versions.
For example, at the time of this
writing, we've got 5 different versions of the glibc external, each
living in their own subdirectory of
  <code>
   externals/bundles/glibc
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">externals/
         /bundles/
                 /glibc/
                       /2.3.2.27.9.7/
                       /2.5-20061008T1257-p0/
                       /2.5-20061008T1257-x86_64-p0/
                       /2.7-18/
                       /2.7-18-x86_64/
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Inside each version-specific subdirectory, are several things:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    CMakeLists.txt
   </code>
   which describes how to build the external. It will include the URL to download the source tarball(s) from. (ideally, exactly what you'd download from the authors distribution, unmodified)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    build_[package-name]
   </code>
   A build script, usually partnered with
a Windows specific script in the form
   <code>
    build_[package-name].bat
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Optionally, there may be patch file(s) which include modifications
we had to make to the package to get it to work with HTCondor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each of these things are addressed in the following sections...
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Setting up the source tarball
 </h3>
 <p>
  In theory there's nothing you should need to do to modify the source
tarball of the external package.  We want the original, unmodified
source whenever possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  In practice you'll need to repackage the tar.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the name of the tarball must be in the form
  <code>
   [package-name].tar.gz
  </code>
  .
Second, the contents of the tarball must be in a subdirected named
  <code>
   [package-name]
  </code>
  .  The current CMakeLists.txt assume this.  For
example, "
  <code>
   krb5-1.2.8.tar.gz
  </code>
  ".
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Putting the source tarball on the web server
 </h3>
 <p>
  Source tarballs are synced periodically from the following directories on AFS at UW-CS:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    /p/condor/repository/externals
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    /p/condor/repository/externals-private
   </code>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The latter is for files that can't be publicly distributed. Currently, the only thing there is a LIGO application for testing standard universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Be sure that the tarball is world readable.
 </p>

  The files are copied to the webserver on parrot.cs.wisc.edu every 10 minutes by a cron script running as cndrutil.
The files are copied to local disk on parrot and AFS permissions are not used, only standard Unix permissions.  Note that if you're logging into parrot, you should instead ssh into phoenix.cs.wisc.edu; if you ssh into parrot your AFS tokens won't be correctly created.
 </p>
 <p>
  On parrot, the files are copied to
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    /scratch/externals
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    /scratch/externals-private
   </code>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once synced, the files can be fetched from the following URLS:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    <a class="external" href="http://parrot.cs.wisc.edu/externals">
     http://parrot.cs.wisc.edu/externals
    </a>
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    <a class="external" href="http://parrot.cs.wisc.edu/externals-private">
     http://parrot.cs.wisc.edu/externals-private
    </a>
   </code>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once you place a tarball in
  <code>
   /p/condor/repository/externals
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   /p/condor/repository/externals-private
  </code>
  , you shouldn't change it. You must not change it once a mention of it is pushed to the shared git repository. If the contents of your source tarball(s) may change while you're preparing to push your changes, you have two options for temporarily locating the tarballs:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Local builds
   </strong>
   Place the tarball directly in the external's directory. Modify the package's CMakeFiles.txt, looking for ExternalProject_Add. Inside that function call, comment out the "DOWNLOAD_COMMAND" line. Comment out the "URL" line and add a new one that looks like "URL /full/path/to/my/tarball.tar.gz".  This will only work on your localhost.  You cannot use a relative path in the URL.
   <strong>
    Do not push any commits that contain the full tarball to the public git repository.
   </strong>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Local webserver
   </strong>
   Place the tarball at some other ftp or http location. Your CS web page ({link:
   <a class="external" href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~username">
    http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~username
   </a>
   <a class="external" href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~username">
    http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~username
   </a>
   ) or the temporary directory under HTCondor's anonymous ftp server are possibilities.  Then edit the CMakeLists.txt to load the unusual location.  You'll be changing the DOWNLOAD_COMMAND and URL arguments to  ExternalProject_Add.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h3>
  Making the build script
 </h3>
 <p>
  When the HTCondor build is trying to build your external, first it
will create a temporary sandbox build directory. The
[name]-[version].tar.gz will be downloaded and untarred into the sandbox.  Then, the
  <code>
   build_[name]-[version]
  </code>
  script will be invoked with the
current working directory set to the sandbox build directory.  This
script is responsible for building the external package in whatever
way makes sense.  The calling layer assumes the responsibility of
cleaning up the build sandbox.  It will also keep track of whether or
not things need to be rebuilt.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsubsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h4>
  Build script environment variables
 </h4>
 <p>
  In addition to being born with the build sandbox directory as the
current working directory, the following environment variables will be
set (these are literal... no substitution of package name or
anything):
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  $PACKAGE_NAME           # the name of this package
  $PACKAGE_SRC_NAME       # package name from source tarball
  $PACKAGE_DEBUG          # empty if release, '-g' if debug build
  $PACKAGE_BUILD_DIR      # the sandbox build directory
  $PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIR    # where to put the results
  $EXTERNALS_INSTALL_DIR  # full path to root of externals/install
  $EXTERNALS_CONFIG       # full path to config.sh with config variables
</pre>
 </div>
 }
 <p>
  <code>
   $PACKAGE_NAME
  </code>
  is the
  <code>
   [name]-[version]
  </code>
  identifying
string for your package.
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   $PACKAGE_SRC_NAME
  </code>
  is the same as
  <code>
   $PACKAGE_NAME
  </code>
  , except it
will not have any
  <code>
   -p&lt;number&gt;
  </code>
  on the end if the source tarball
doesn't have it. This simplifies allowing multiple external versions to use
the same source tarball.
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   $PACKAGE_BUILD_DIR
  </code>
  is a subdirectory of
  <code>
   externals/build
  </code>
  , named with the
  <code>
   package-name
  </code>
  .
This is just a temporary sandbox directory, and
  <code>
   build_external
  </code>
  will remove this directory and all its
contents as soon as your build script exits.
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   $PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIR
  </code>
  is a subdirectory of
  <code>
   externals/install
  </code>
  , named with the
  <code>
   package-name
  </code>
  as
well.  This directory won't necessarily exist when your build script
is spawned, so your script is responsible for creating this directory
in whatever way is appropriate for your package.  Most packages don't
have to worry about it, since
  <code>
   make install
  </code>
  takes care of it
for you.  Some packages need to copy a whole tree to this location, so
we don't want to make you
  <code>
   rmdir
  </code>
  if you don't want it there in
the first place.  However, the parent of this directory (the directory
path stored in
  <code>
   $EXTERNALS_INSTALL_DIR
  </code>
  ) is guaranteed to
exist, so you don't need to worry about
  <code>
   mkdir -p
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  If your build script wants to know things that the HTCondor build
system determines at run-time (for example, what globus flavor we're
trying to build), it can source the file specified in
  <code>
   $EXTERNALS_CONFIG
  </code>
  (details on sourcing this file below).
This is a simple bourne shell syntax file that defines a bunch of
shell variables that hold information that the
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  script discovers.  If your external needs to know something that the
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  script figures out but that isn't yet in
  <code>
   config/config.sh
  </code>
  , all you have to do is add a new line to
  <code>
   config/config.sh.in
  </code>
  to define the variable you need.  Also,
note that if you want to pass any of these variables onto the
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  script or build system of your package, you either
have to pass them in as arguments or manually export them yourself as
environment varialbes (by default, you just get shell variables in
your script, not environment variables).
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsubsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h4>
  Build script syntax
 </h4>
 <p>
  <strong>
   YOUR BUILD SCRIPT MUST BE PLAIN OLD BOURNE SHELL!!!
  </strong>
  .
Do
  <strong>
   NOT
  </strong>
  use any bash syntax, since it won't work on all 15+
HTCondor platforms.  For example,
  <code>
   source
  </code>
  is not portable across
all versions of bourne shell.  The correct way to include this file in
your build script is to use:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  . $EXTERNALS_CONFIG
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Similarly, to set an environment variable, you can
  <strong>
   NOT
  </strong>
  do this:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  export FOO=bar
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  You
  <strong>
   MUST
  </strong>
  use:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  FOO=bar
  export FOO
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Another shell idiom that does
  <strong>
   NOT
  </strong>
  work is using this:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  if( ! make ); then blah blah; fi
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  You
  <strong>
   MUST
  </strong>
  use:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">make
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
    blah blah
fi
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  <span class="subsubsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h4>
  Build script exit codes
 </h4>
 <p>
  If your script encounters an error during the build, exit with status 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  After building, you should run any tests that are available.
 </p>
 <p>
  If any tests do not pass or any other error occurs, exit with status 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  After passing tests, you script should install the package into the
directory
  <code>
   $PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIR
  </code>
  in whatever format is
customary for that package.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there is a problem during installation, exit with status 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there is any problem specific to your package, exit with status 10 or
higher.  Status 4-9 is reserved for future use.  You can only exit with
status 0 if everything is fully installed and working (to the best of your
knowledge).
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsubsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h4>
  Build script example
 </h4>
 <p>
  Here is an example
  <code>
   build_generic_package
  </code>
  , which would
build most things that follow the common tar and 'configure / make /
make test / make install' convention:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">#!/bin/sh
############# build_generic_package

cd $PACKAGE_SRC_NAME/src
./configure --prefix=$PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIR --with-ccopts=$PACKAGE_DEBUG

make
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
    echo "make failed"
    exit 1
fi

make test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
    echo "test failed"
    exit 2
fi

make install
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
    echo "install failed"
    exit 3
fi

exit 0

############# end of build_generic_package
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">

 </p>
 <h3>
  Handling patches (optional)
 </h3>
 <p>
  If your external needs to be patched, the preferred method for
dealing with it is to create patch files, and put those patches into
the version-specific subdirectory.  Then, the build-script for the
package can invoke
  <code>
   patch
  </code>
  as needed.  An example to look at
would be the
  <code>
   krb5-1.2.5
  </code>
  external
(
  <code>
   externals/bundles/krb5/1.2.5/
  </code>
  )
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, if you want to add additional patches to an existing
external, you
  <strong>
   MUST
  </strong>
  make an entirely new external package with a
different version number (e.g. like
  <code>
   krb5-1.2.5-p1
  </code>
  )
so that we can tell the difference between the two versions.  This is
a little wasteful of space, unfortunately, but there's no way around
that at this time.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <span class="section">
  <h2>
   Telling the build system about the new package
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  Once your package is setup in the externals tree and the build
script is ready, you've got to tell the HTCondor build system about the new
package.  There are a few separate places that this needs to happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Changing autoconf-related stuff
 </h3>
 <p>
  The first step in integrating a new external with the build system
is to modify
  <code>
   src/configure.ac
  </code>
  , the input file for
  <code>
   autoconf
  </code>
  .  Near the bottom of this file, there's a section of
tests that determine what version of each external we want to use.
The section begins with the following code block:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  ############################################################
  # What versions of what externals do we need
  ############################################################
  AC_MSG_NOTICE([determining versions of external packages])
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Some of the "tests" are trivial, they just define a version to use
directly.  Other tests do something more fancy, like choose a version
depending on the platform we're on.  Ultimately,
  <code>
   autoconf
  </code>
  is
just a fancy way of using M4 macros to make a giant bourne shell
script.  If you following the existing syntax and examples already in
this section, you should be in good shape.  If you have trouble,
either check out the
  <code>
   autoconf
  </code>
  documentation (for example autoconf 2.57).
 </p>
 <p>
  The important thing is that once you know what version of the external
you need, that you call our special autoconf macro,
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   CHECK_EXTERNAL()
  </code>
  , which handles everything else for
you.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, here's a simple case, zlib:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  CHECK_EXTERNAL([zlib],[1.1.3], [soft])
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  This handles the following tasks for you:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Defines what version of zlib we need.
  </li>
  <li>
   Checks that the given version of zlib exists in the
    externals tree the build is configured to use.
  </li>
  <li>
   Prints out a message to the screen about the version of zlib we're
    going to be using.
  </li>
  <li>
   Tells autoconf that any file it is producing should
    substitute any occurrence of
   <code>
    @ext_zlib_version@
   </code>
   with the
    value "
   <code>
    zlib-1.1.3
   </code>
   ".
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Provides you with
   <code>
    HAVE_EXT_ZLIB
   </code>
   for use in
    =#ifdef='s, if the zlib is found.
  </li>
  <li>
   Tells autoconf that the external is a soft requirement. More
    on this later.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If you're just changing the version of an existing external, that's
probably all you'll have to do to the
  <code>
   autoconf
  </code>
  stuff, and you
can skip right to the discussion of
  <code>
   git
  </code>
  changes.
However, if you're adding a whole new external package, there are a
few more steps (both for
  <code>
   autoconf
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   imake
  </code>
  , so read
on... In either case, before using your new external you should run
  <code>
   ./build_init
  </code>
  to repopulate the cf files with correct info.
 </p>
 <p>
  To add a whole new kind of external, you've got to understand a
bit about that
  <code>
   [soft]
  </code>
  argument (the requirement level), modify
  <code>
   config/externals.cf.in
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   config/config.sh.in
  </code>
  to
hold the results of the new test you added in
  <code>
   src/configure.ac
  </code>
  .  Again, if you just edit the files and
follow the existing examples, you'll probably be in fine shape.  But,
for the sake of complete docs, I'll explain in a little more detail
here:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   requirement levels
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are three requirement levels, and they determine how
dependent HTCondor is on an external. The levels are
  <code>
   soft
  </code>
  ,
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   hard
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   optional
  </code>
  . The
  <code>
   soft
  </code>
  level is the
most common and is likely what you need to specify. It means that
HTCondor can compile and operate just fine without the external. When
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  is run it will look for
  <code>
   soft
  </code>
  requirements,
but will only give a warning if they are not available. This is in
contrast to
  <code>
   hard
  </code>
  requirements, which are always
required. HTCondor either will not compile or run without them. They
MUST be present. Not being present will cause
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  to
fail. You want to avoid adding
  <code>
   hard
  </code>
  externals to HTCondor. The
third level,
  <code>
   optional
  </code>
  , is just as uncommon as
  <code>
   hard
  </code>
  ,
if not more. It operates almost exactly as
  <code>
   soft
  </code>
  with one
exception: there is a
  <code>
   --with-soft-is-hard
  </code>
  option that can be
given to
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  to treat all
  <code>
   soft
  </code>
  requirements as
if they were
  <code>
   hard
  </code>
  requirements. This option does not change
how
  <code>
   optional
  </code>
  externals are treated. So, you really want your
external to be a
  <code>
   soft
  </code>
  , unless you have a really good reason
for it not to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   config/externals.cf.in
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important thing is to define a new
  <code>
   make
  </code>
  variable
to hold the version of the external you added.  For example, here's
what happens for zlib:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  EXT_ZLIB_VERSION = @ext_zlib_version@
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  The rest of the build system that needs to know how to find zlib
can now use this variable.  Almost always, what we really care about
is the installed output of the external build.  This is a common way
to deal with that:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  ZLIB_DIR = $(EXT_INSTALL)/$(EXT_ZLIB_VERSION)
  ZLIB_LIB = $(ZLIB_DIR)/lib
  ZLIB_INC = $(ZLIB_DIR)/include
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Obviously, the details depend on the specifics of a given package, but
in general, something like the above is what you want to do.  This
way, we have the full path to the
  <code>
   lib
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   include
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  directories for the external, and each of those
  <code>
   make
  </code>
  variables can be used in regular HTCondor
  <code>
   imake
  </code>
  input files so
that the HTCondor build can use the external.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong class="two">
   config/config.sh.in
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <code>
   config/config.sh.in
  </code>
  file is converted by
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  into
  <code>
   config/config.sh
  </code>
  .  The full path to
this
  <code>
   config.sh
  </code>
  file is passed into the
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   externals/build_external
  </code>
  script by the HTCondor build system,
which in turn sets it as the
  <code>
   $EXTERNALS_CONFIG
  </code>
  environment
variable.  This way, the package-specific build scripts can use
information that
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  discovers if that information is
necessary to build an external.  In general, this is only needed when
a given external depends on a different external.  For example, the
gahp external needs to know where the globus external was
installed, and what "globus flavor" was built.  The blahp external also
needs to know if the platform we're on is trying to build a
statically-linked version of HTCondor or not.   So,
  <code>
   config/config.sh
  </code>
  defines the following variables:
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  ...
  GLOBUS_FLAVOR=...
  EXT_GLOBUS_VERSION=...
  HAS_STATIC=...
  ...
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Inside
  <code>
   build_gahp-1.0.10
  </code>
  , we use the following code:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  . $EXTERNALS_CONFIG

  FLAVOR="--with-flavor=$GLOBUS_FLAVOR"
  GLOBUS="--with-globus=$EXTERNALS_INSTALL_DIR/$EXT_GLOBUS_VERSION"
  STATIC_BUILD="--with-static=$HAS_STATIC"

  cd $PACKAGE_BUILD_DIR/$PACKAGE_NAME/

  ./configure --prefix=$PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIR $GLOBUS $FLAVOR $STATIC_BUILD
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Changing imake-related stuff
 </h3>
 <p>
  NOTE: if you're just changing the version of an existing external,
you probably don't have to mess with any
  <code>
   imake
  </code>
  stuff at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once
  <code>
   autoconf
  </code>
  knows all about your new external, and the
various
  <code>
   make
  </code>
  variables have been set in the files in
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   config
  </code>
  , there are a few minor changes to the
  <code>
   imake
  </code>
  input files themselves that need to be made so the HTCondor build knows
about the external.  In particular, the
  <code>
   src/Imakefile
  </code>
  needs
to know about your external.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do this, all you have to do is add a new
  <code>
   ext_target
  </code>
  to
the file.  This magic
  <code>
   imake
  </code>
  rule handles all the details of
ensuring the HTCondor build depends on your external, and that
  <code>
   externals/build_external
  </code>
  is invoked to build your external at
the appropriate time.  This target takes two arguments, the package
name (which should be held in the
  <code>
   make
  </code>
  variable
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   EXT_[NAME]_VERSION
  </code>
  ), and any externals your package depends
on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's the boring zlib example.  There, nothing to it, since we
always want this external built, and it doesn't depend on anything
else:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">  ext_target(EXT_ZLIB_VERSION,$(NULL))
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Here's the complicated globus example.  It depends on the GPT
external, and we only want to build it if the
  <code>
   HAVE_EXT_GLOBUS
  </code>
  imake #define is set, which happens when
  <code>
   configure
  </code>
  finds the
globus external:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">#if HAVE_EXT_GLOBUS
ext_target(EXT_GLOBUS_VERSION,$(EXT_TRIGGER)/$(EXT_GPT_VERSION))
...
#endif
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Note the use of
  <code>
   $(EXT_TRIGGER)
  </code>
  .  That's how
  <code>
   imake
  </code>
  (and therefore,
  <code>
   make
  </code>
  ) know a given external was successfully
built.
  <code>
   $(EXT_TRIGGER)
  </code>
  holds the full path to the
  <code>
   triggers
  </code>
  directory (described above).  Each trigger file is
just named with the package name.  So, by making the globus external
depend on
  <code>
   $(EXT_TRIGGER)/$(EXT_GPT_VERSION)
  </code>
  , we ensure that
GPT is built before Globus.
 </p>
 <p>
  If your external depends on multiple other externals, all you have
to do is include multiple trigger files (separated by spaces) in the
second argument to
  <code>
   ext_target
  </code>
  .  For example:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="code">
  <pre class="code">ext_target(EXT_FOO_VERSION,$(EXT_TRIGGER)/$(EXT_BAR_VERSION) $(EXT_TRIGGER)/$(EXT_BAZ_VERSION))
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  Finally, there's the tricky subject of exactly how the HTCondor
  <code>
   imake
  </code>
  system should use your external and integrate it with
the rest of the HTCondor source.  Eventually we'll have a better answer
for that question here.  For now, if it's not totally obvious, just
talk to someone else on the staff and try to come up with something
good.  When in doubt, ask Derek.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once all this is done, you're in a position to fully test your new
external with a HTCondor build.  You'll have to re-run
  <code>
   autoconf
  </code>
  to generate
  <code>
   src/configure
  </code>
  and re-run the
  <code>
   src/configure
  </code>
  script itself.  After that, a top-level
 </p>
 <p>
  <code>
   make
  </code>
  inside
  <code>
   src
  </code>
  should be all you need to see your
external package built.  Once your external build is working and the
HTCondor source sees and uses the new external, you're ready to commit
your changes to git.

  <h2>
   Dealing with externals caches
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  The HTCondor build system allows built externals to be stored outside of your immediate build tree. These external caches can be shared across multiple build locations, greatly reducing the time to do a fresh build of HTCondor. This is why changing anything in how an external is built requires you to create a new version of the external.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cache has one directory per package and version number.
 </p>
 <p>
  Externals are, by default, built and stored in /scratch/condor-externals; you can change this default location with something like -DEXTERNAL_STAGE:PATH=/path/to/a/private/directory when you invoke cmake.

  Updating/upgrading
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Update build/cmake/CondorConfigure.cmake, looking for a line like
   <div class="code">
    <pre class="code">add_subdirectory(${CONDOR_EXTERNAL_DIR}/bundles/krb5/1.4.3-p1)
</pre>
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   A Windows specific build file (build-*.bat) may have the version number hard coded into it.  You'll need to update it by hand.
  </li>
  <li>
   The version number is embedded in externals/bundle/packagename/version/CMakeLists.txt. Look for something like
   <div class="code">
    <pre class="code">        condor_pre_external( KRB5 krb5-1.4.3-p0 "lib;include" "include/krb5.h")</pre>
   </div>
