Changes for version 0.9.8: (released 14-Jun-2006)

* The build now uses implicit template instantiation by default. Explicit
  template instantiation is still available by providing the
  --use-explicit-templates option to configure.

* Added support for compiling with stlport (known to work with stlport5.0RC6).

* Added SWIG interface for Perl.

* Fixed segmentation fault that occured when evaluating lists that are
  not within a ClassAd. 

* Added a ClassAdCollection::GetView() function. In combination with
  the existing view iterators, you can now iterate over an entire
  view, including the "root" view. 

* Some missing "virtual" keywords were added for virtual destructors

* A bunch of -Wuninitialized warnings were corrected.

* regexprMember has been added.

* The subscript operator now returns error instead of undefined if the
  argument is out of bounds.

* -0.0 is now handled correctly. 

* You can now do math with booleans. True is 1, False is 0. This lets
  us do things like:

  Rank = ((other.mips > 4000)*3) + ((other.ram > 1000)*2) +
         (other.disk>1400)

  This is frequently done in Condor, and we need this functionality in
  order to be backwards compatible.
