In 7.5.4 and beyond, the default is for the startd to send keep-alives to the schedd. If a daemon detects that it's talking to a pre-7.5.4 peer, it will revert to the old default of the schedd sending the keep-alives.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Aug-12 12:06</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/8776943bf5a1892ce78e3b3c3f31fcfb78d3c706\">[18809]</a></span>: Reverse direction of alive messages between schedd and startd <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1420\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1420'); return false;\" title=\"Change default for STARTD_SENDS_ALIVES\">#1420</a></span> <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=671\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('671'); return false;\" title=\"RFE: reverse direction of alive messages, go with startd-&gt;schedd\">#671</a></span> Claim keep-alives now default to being sent by the startd, rather than the schedd.
