Maintainer might have a touch of difficulty getting it approved as it appears to have died off 11 years ago.  In Fedora, I believe the preference is to do this rather than bundle: <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:No_Bundled_Libraries\">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:No_Bundled_Libraries</a>.\n</li><li>Any artifacts in the RPM must be built from source. This explicitly includes Java JAR files.  So, you can't include the binary JAR plus sources; it must be rebuilt.  <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#No_inclusion_of_pre-built_binaries_or_libraries\">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#No_inclusion_of_pre-built_binaries_or_libraries</a>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Dec-20 13:43:24 by mih:</em> <br/>\n\nThis applies one-to-one to Debian as well.
