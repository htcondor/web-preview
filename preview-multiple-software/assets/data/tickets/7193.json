{"id": 7193, "title": "Ticket #7193: Schedd blocked for 5 minutes on ssh_to_job", "description": "<blockquote>\nToday, I encountered a situation where the schedd on submit-1.chtc.wisc.edu was blocked for 5 minutes. The cause was a deadlock triggered by ssh-to-job, which I don't believe has been reported before. Here are the legs of the deadlock:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>In response to a GET_JOB_CONNECT_INFO request, the schedd is making a blocking connection to the starter to do a CREATE_JOB_OWNER_SEC_SESSION command. The CEDAR timeout is 300 seconds.\n</li><li>The starter is about to start the job and is making a <code>begin_execution</code> RPC to the shadow.\n</li><li>Having just finished input file transfer, the shadow is attempting to connect to the schedd to push job ad changes related to the transfer. The CEDAR timeout is 300 seconds.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>As a short term fix, the schedd's timeout for CREATE_JOB_OWNER_SEC_SESSION could be shortened (years of careful research would suggest 20 seconds). In the long term, making one of the connection attempts non-blocking would be better.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Aug-08 15:34:27 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe timeout for schedd connecting to the startd and starter was originally 20 seconds.
