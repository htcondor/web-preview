{"id": 7279, "title": "Ticket #7279: Late materialization from mismatched bindings version fails silently", "description": "<blockquote>\nDue to bad config, I ended up in a situation where I tried to submit late materialization jobs from 8.9 Python bindings into a 8.8 schedd. The submit returned successfully, but no jobs ever entered the queue.\n\n<p>TJ believes the basic problem is that the schedd doesn't try to materialize until after it has already returned. The late materialization digest is effectively malformed because the schedd doesn't know how to read the 8.9 version of the digest.\n\n</p><p>Also relevant for remote submit, or simply mismatched tools/daemons versions on the same machine.\n\n</p><p>Fix: the schedd should be able to report which versions of the digest it supports, and submit should fail if it can't produce a digest of that version.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Oct-22 14:42:02 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nno version history, late materialization is still not an official feature.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Sep-25 10:00</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/ee96999933457f8a13f12a6bbd5e05d8fc07a80f\">[57918]</a></span>: fix for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7279\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7279'); return false;\" title=\"Late materialization from mismatched bindings version fails silently\">#7279</a></span>, Don't allow late materialization submits between 8.9 tools and 8.8 schedd because the submit digest is not compatible between these versions. ===VersionHistory:pending===  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-Oct-22 14:42", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-Sep-23 14:49", "fixed_version": "2019-Sep-23 14:49", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "PythonBinding", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "karpel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "karpel@wisc.edu johnkn@cs.wis.edu", "due_date": ""}
