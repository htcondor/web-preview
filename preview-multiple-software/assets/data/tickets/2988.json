{"id": 2988, "title": "Ticket #2988: add an input file cache", "description": "<blockquote>\nIgor discussed caching of transferred input files with Todd and Miron, because UCSDGrid users frequently have short jobs with large input sandboxes that contain files shared by many jobs.\n\n<p>There was concern about how to guarantee that the file in the cache is the same as the file the next job is requesting.  Igor says it would be useful to support caching without solving the general case.  We should limit ourselves to only the use case where the user tells us he is not going to change a file between jobs,\nand the (absolute path) file name is enough to guarantee uniqueness.\nOf course, this requires the user to opt in (possibly on a job-by-job basis), since we cannot assume all users are able or willing to guarantee this.\nBut that would solve a large fraction of use cases and definitely Igor's current problem.\n\n</p><p>The files in the cache would not be directly accessible to the user job; they would be owned by the condor user.\nOnly the copy of the file would be available to the job. This way we do not need to worry about the user corrupting the cached file (intentionally or by mistake).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-May-11 09:54", "status": "new", "created": "2012-May-11 09:54", "fixed_version": "2012-May-11 09:54", "broken_version": "v070900", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "isfiligoi@ucsd.edu,dan@hep.wisc.edu,jfrey@cs.wisc.edu,tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
