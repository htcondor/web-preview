The\nemail we got read like this:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  Date: Fri, 27 Jun 2014 09:59:16 +0000\n</pre>\n\n<p></p><pre>  This is an automated email from the Condor system\n  on machine \"glidein-itb.grid.iu.edu\".  Do not reply.\n</pre>\n\n<p></p><pre>  \"/usr/local/glidecondor/sbin/condor_schedd\" on \"glidein-itb.grid.iu.edu\"\n  exited with status 1.\n  Condor will automatically restart this process in 10 seconds.\n</pre>\n\n<p>This notification came less than 12 hours after I upgraded the factory in\nquestion to use HTCondor 8.2.0. We haven't seen warnings like this on\nprevious Condor versions, so we suspect something endemic to this version.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Jul-18 10:59:39 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- I was looking at the log files to attach the relevant segment to this ticket, and I noticed that each time the schedd core dumped, it was just after a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> log rotation (and a SIGHUP).  I hadn't noticed the log rotation aspect previously...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Feb-11 16:04:06 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nIs this ticket still valid?  Per the lack of recent complaints from the factory, I propose closing.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Jun-29 14:27:26 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nHaven't heard anything, abandoning</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/837/SchedLog_partial\">SchedLog_partial</a>\n4079 bytes added by wenger on 2014-Jul-18 16:00:24 UTC.\n</li><li><a href=\"../files/838/stack_trace_w_syms2\">stack_trace_w_syms2</a>\n4245 bytes added by wenger on 2014-Jul-18 16:00:42 UTC.\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Jun-29 14:27", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2014-Jul-18 10:48", "fixed_version": "2014-Jul-18 10:48", "broken_version": "v080200", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "s8448", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu,", "due_date": ""}
