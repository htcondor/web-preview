These queries occasionally time out, likely due to heavy load on the schedd. They would like a way to increase the timeout for these query operations from within the python bindings. Currently, the best way to modify the timeouts is to set TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER in the config file.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Oct-17 13:46:48 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe timeouts can be lengthened from within python by setting TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER via the environment.\nThis code snippet will double all of the network timeouts in subsequent Condor calls:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">os.environ[\"_condor_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER\"] = 2\nhtcondor.reload_config()\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-Oct-17 13:46", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Oct-09 11:56", "fixed_version": "2018-Oct-09 11:56", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "PythonBinding", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "atlas", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
