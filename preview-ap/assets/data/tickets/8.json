{"id": 8, "title": "Ticket #8: Add \"use warnings\" and \"use strict\" to test scripts", "description": "<blockquote>\nOur regression tests (src/condor_tests) are built primarily on Perl.  Ideally all of our Perl scripts would \"use strict\" and \"use warnings\".  The combination catches a lot of bugs, both serious and minor.  For example, I discovered a script that printed a variable that could not possibly be assigned.  This meant the resulting message was a bit nonsensical, since part of the output was missing.   Either \"use strict\" or \"use warnings\" would catch the bug quickly (complaining that the variable wasn't defined, or that undef was being printed, respectively).\n\n<p>So: Add \"use strict\" and \"use warnings\" whenever possible in our test scripts.  Attached is a script that will scan a directory and report perl scripts that need attention.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nThe process is started but will be ongoing as only the newest perl module uses strict and warnings and virtually nothing else except nicks new tests.  I walked into it that way and continued. I'll have to go slowly so I can fix and quiet it down as I convert each file.\n\n<p>All major perl modules and scripts needed to do testing are now converted.(1/21/9)\n\n</p><p>Placing it as defered in terms of individual tests 1/15/10\n</p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/2/checkwarn\">checkwarn</a>\n351 bytes added by adesmet on 2009-Jan-13 22:09:59 UTC.\n<br/>\nSimple perl script scans local directory for perl scripts and checks that they have \"use warnings\" and \"use strict\" in them.
