{"id": 2760, "title": "Ticket #2760: Condor-G remote state verification tool", "description": "<blockquote>\nIgor Sfiligoi requests a tool users can run that will directly query the status of a Condor-G job from the remote batch system. They regularly have cases where the job status reported by Condor-G is belied by other information. For example, Condor-G says the job is idle, but they are receiving data from the job.\n\n<p>Such a tool would probably be limited to GRAM jobs. Igor proposes it would use the GRAM fork jobmanager to determine the batch system job id and directly query the batch system for the job's status.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Jan-13 10:13", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jan-13 10:12", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-13 10:12", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "s8116", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "jfrey@cs.wisc.edu,sfiligoi@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
