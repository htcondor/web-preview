We need to know this address so we can reconstruct the original Sinful string for backwards compatibility.  This also allows to us to round-trip between the original Sinful string, through AddressV1, and back to the original Sinful string.\n\n</p><p>While you would expect that the primary address is always one of the addresses in the addrs parameter of the original Sinful string -- and thus readily representable in a more-compact way -- that's not always the case.
