Some code could be written in the middle <code>param_*</code> layer to EXCEPT in this case to help a person performing the API change.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Mar-30 13:52", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jul-30 13:40", "fixed_version": "2009-Jul-30 13:40", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#123", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
