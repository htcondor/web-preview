{"id": 7058, "title": "Ticket #7058: Windows installer fails to create config if in Program Files dir", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe Windows MSI installer will fail to create the initial condor_config and condor_config.local files when condor is installed into a directory with spaces in the pathnames.   Like, for instance \"C:\\Program Files\\Condor\".  This is most likely caused by some command that the installer runs that should be quoting the path but is not.\n\n<p>When the user fixed the problem by hand, he ran into an additional problem with initializing the file transfer plugins when there was a space in the path to the bin dir.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"term\">\n<pre class=\"term\">05/21/19 13:19:45 (pid:8804) my_popen: CreateProcess failed err=2\n05/21/19 13:19:45 (pid:8804) FILETRANSFER: Failed to execute C:\\Program, ignoring\n05/21/19 13:19:45 (pid:8804) FILETRANSFER: failed to add plugin \"C:\\Program\" because: FILETRANSFER:1:Failed to execute C:\\Program, ignoring\n05/21/19 13:19:45 (pid:8804) my_popen: CreateProcess failed err=2\n05/21/19 13:19:45 (pid:8804) FILETRANSFER: Failed to execute Files\\Condor\\bin\\curl_plugin.exe, ignoring\n05/21/19 13:19:45 (pid:8804) FILETRANSFER: failed to add plugin \"Files\\Condor\\bin\\curl_plugin.exe\" because: FILETRANSFER:1:Failed to execute Files\\Condor\\bin\\curl_plugin.exe, ignoring|FILETRANSFER:1:Failed to execute C:\\Program, ignoring\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>We need to figure out where the installer is failing to create the config, and in addition, it should be writing a short path name into the config as the RELEASE_DIR and/or LOCAL_DIR config knobs.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Oct-12 10:02", "status": "new", "created": "2019-May-21 08:17", "fixed_version": "2019-May-21 08:17", "broken_version": "v080613", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
