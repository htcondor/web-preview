{"id": 3063, "title": "Ticket #3063: JobRouter should apply limits per-submitter", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobRouter\" title=\"Job Router\">JobRouter</a></span> currently provides very useful limits on the total number of jobs and idle jobs per route.\n\n<p>I'd like to see these limits extended to be applied per-user.  This is useful in the context of the Condor-CE. On the OSG, we occasionally see one submitter dump a huge number of jobs (by bug or on purpose) on a CE.\n\n</p><p>We would like to limit the impact of such a case on the batch system while retaining the other users' ability to submit.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Feb-25 11:22:45 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nProbably not so relevant these days as everything is pilot-based.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Feb-25 11:22", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2012-Jun-15 10:40", "fixed_version": "2012-Jun-15 10:40", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
