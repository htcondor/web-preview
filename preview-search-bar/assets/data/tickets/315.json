{"id": 315, "title": "Ticket #315: crondor runs jobs repeatedly after release from hold", "description": "<blockquote>\nI ran into a case where after being released from hold, a crondor job ran over and over as fast as condor could reschedule it until its deferral window ran out.  After that, the job never got scheduled to run again until the schedd was restarted.\n\n<p>How to produce the problem:\n\n</p><p>Submit a cron job but before doing so, remove the execute permission from the executable, so the first time the job runs, it will go on hold.  Example submit file:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">universe = local\nexecutable = my_script\nnotification = never\nlog = ulog\non_exit_remove = false\ncron_minute = 3\ncron_hour = *\ncron_window = 1800\ncron_prep_time = 600\nqueue\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Once the job goes on hold, turn on the execute permission on the executable and release the job.  It will then run over and over until the deferral window expires.  Then it will not be scheduled to run ever again until the schedd is restarted.\n\n</p><p>Since OSG relies on crondor, screwy behavior like this is a fairly important problem.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Oct-16 19:23:03 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is still a problem with 7.9.2.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Oct-16 19:23", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Mar-10 18:24", "fixed_version": "2009-Mar-10 18:24", "broken_version": "v070200", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
