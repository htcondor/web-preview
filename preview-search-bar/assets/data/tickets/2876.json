{"id": 2876, "title": "Ticket #2876: Ensure Arguments is always in job ad, even if old Args is being used", "description": "<blockquote>\nDepending on how a job was submitted, with old or new style arguments, a job <span class=\"quote\">ClassAd</span> will have either Args or Arguments, but not both.  This complicates things for a user that wants to, say, use -format to see the arguments no matter how the job was submitted.  It also means that code handling arguments needs to be smart enough to handle both.\n\n<p>Proposed: ensure that Arguments is always set.  It is always possible to transform Args into an Arguments equivalent. Do so in condor_submit.  Keep the old Args for backward compatibility with user scripts, but deprecate it and remove internal usage of it.\n\n</p><p>This is a possible way to also fix <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2875\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2875'); return false;\" title=\"Jobs with new style arguments don't show args in condor_q\">#2875</a></span>: Jobs with new style arguments don't show args in condor_q.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Mar-08 17:47", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Mar-08 17:47", "fixed_version": "2012-Mar-08 17:47", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
