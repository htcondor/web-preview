    <h1>Full Port Log Debian Six Sixty Four Bit</h1>
<div id="content">
 This is a record of the work necessary to perform a full port of HTCondor
to Debian 6 x86_64.

 <h2>
  Preparation of a new glibc external
 </h2>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Locate and see how glibc builds
 </h3>
 <p>
  We must locate the glibc revision that comes standard with the
platform.  This is different than locating the "official" glibc
release since which is distro independent. It turns out each linux
distro patches glibc according to its wishes and we need to preserve
those patches. Historically, the is enough difference between the x86
and x86_64 patches or builds that the same external CANNOT be used for
both. It is very time intensive to discover if a vendor patched glibc
source tree can be built/run properly on the another architecture.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Find the glibc source rpm associated with Deb 6 x86_64.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  apt-get source libc6
</pre>
 <p>
  2. Prepare it so the patches are produced saving the output:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  # In my case, it was 2.11.2
  cd eglibc-2.11.2
  debian/rules patch
</pre>
 <p>
  3. Save the resulting tarball:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  cd ..
  cp -Rp eglibc-2.11.2 glibc-2.11.2-10-x86_64
  tar czf glibc-2.11.2-10-x86_64.tar.gz glibc-2.11.2-10-x86_64
</pre>
 <p>
  4. Now, build the glibc source package in order to find out how it is being
   configured. The purpose of this is we have to compile glibc the same way
   in our externals. Or at least as close as we can get it. We intend to
   discover the configure line which builds glibc itself. You will likely
   have to edit the configure flags to be a good set.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>  cd eglibc-2.11.2
  debian/rules build |&amp; tee build.out
</pre>
 <p>
  The package gcc-multilib needs to be installed to compile glibc
from the distro source. This is because it also compiles the 32
bit versions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Create the glibc external
 </h3>
 <p>
  0. Figure out how cmake detects the GLIBC_VERSION variable, make sure it is
    right.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Edit CMakeLists.txt to add a new case for the detected GLIBC_VERSION.
    Ensure no conflicts with previous version numbers happen. Fill it
    in similarly to the last recent one, taking into consideration
    the new configure flags determined by inspection of build.out
    from the previous step. You may need to comment out the GLIBC_PATCH step
    for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Create a directory in the externals based upon the name of the GLIBC_VERSION.
    Your future patches, if any, go here.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Place the required tarball into /p/condor/repository/externals, ensure it
    has permissions of 644.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Test build it with 'make glibc' after the build has been configured.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Patch glibc so it honors --enable-static-nss &amp; other features specific to us
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the Debian 5 port of HTCondor, we had patched glibc to make
--enable-static-nss function and also turned off the ncsd support. This
is because we needed a truely static binary, and the ncsd socket was
kept permanently open which defered checkpointing permanently.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, we need to determine how much of this is still true and still needs
patching in the new glibc.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. It turns out the patchfile to enable static nss from glibc external 2.7-18
    works for the deb6 glibc.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. TODO I haven't yet tested the nscd patch
 </p>
 <p>
  3. TODO Add a patch which removes the warning about using nss function in
    statically linked executables. It sucks and just causes rust.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  Check glibc external build
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ok, now we have to inspect the produced libraries and ensure that we are
shipping everything we should be shipping. This include libc.a and a pile
of resolver libraries like libnss_files.a, libnss_dns.a, and libresolv.a.
Since glibc is an evolving library, these names may change or there might
be additional libraries to ship along with it. So some of the above steps
may be redone upon future knowledge discovery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Start a build of HTCondor and see what breaks. Fix incrementally.
 </h2>
 <p>
  Ok, lots of stuff broke. The gist of what broke (prototypes being
different, etc) looks to be because wherever we had GLIBC212 as a
preprocessor check we likely also need GLIBC211. I need to check to see
if the GLIBC211 behavior still applies to GLIBC212.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. GLIBC211 addition steps:
    Every place I found a reference to GLIBC212, I checked to see if
    it was valid on GLIBC212 and added GLIBC211 if it was.
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh, it franks. That's quicker than I thought. Meh, onward ho.

 <h2>
  Fixing the Test Suite so it builds
 </h2>
 <p>
  Due to my changes for the Deb 6 x86_64 port, it seems I need to make
no other changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Running the test suite and seeing what breaks
 </h2>
 <p>
  You must build in source for the test suite to function.
 </p>
 <p>
  # First we test just standard universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  ./batch_test -b -c -f list_stduniv -d .
 </p>
 <p>
  job_ckpt_standalone_std seemed to have failed, but the actual activity
the test is doing is ok. I think there is a bug in our runcmd()
implementation.  I looked, and I can't find a bug, well, to tell you
the truth, I found a few bugs simply by code inspection and fixed them,
but they weren't the ones which caused runcmd() to get confused. It just
appears that perl's waitpid() just does something stupid.
 </p>
 <p>
  # Then we remake everything and test the rest too.
 </p>
 <p>
  ./batch_test -b -c -d .
 </p>
 <p>

  Test Suite Passes. Code complete
