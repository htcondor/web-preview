  <h2>
   Current Keeper of the DVDs: adesmet
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  New HTCondor archive DVDs should go to this person.
 </p>
 <p>
  The keeper has a supply of empty sleeves for the DVDs.  You can get some from the keeper in advance, or just give the keeper the bare DVDs to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Labeling
 </h2>
 <p>
  No matter how you burn the DVDs, please label them with:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The version number
  </li>
  <li>
   "1 of 3" (or whatever) so it's easy to determine if a disk is missing
  </li>
  <li>
   Notes about what is on the disk: which disk has the Source is important.  Noting which discs have stripped versus unstripped is useful.  Individual platforms is nice as well.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Archiving on UNIX
 </h2>
 <p>
  Currently, there is no method for archiving a HTCondor release to DVD from the UNIX platform.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="external" href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CSDocs/WritingCD-RomsOnTheLinuxWorkstations">
   http://research.cs.wisc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CSDocs/WritingCD-RomsOnTheLinuxWorkstations
  </a>
  might be useful.  But
  <em>
   be sure to test the results on a Windows PC
  </em>
  , there have been compatibility problems in the past.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <h2>
  Archiving on Windows
 </h2>
 <p>
  This might seem like it has a million little steps you have to get all correct, but in reality most of it is just navigating you through the various GUIs to do what you need to do.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Get a login to robin.cs.wisc.edu in the printer room. It is a standard CSL machine and if you have a UNIX account, you should already be able to log into robin with your csl password.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Get six DVDs for the burn process, you might need less, or more, than this. But you won't know until you actually do the burn process. Don't forget to find a sharpie for labeling the DVDs.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Insert a DVD.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Do start -&gt; run -&gt; P:\condor\public\binaries
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Do start -&gt; run -&gt; C:\temp
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   The hard drive is pretty big, so an entire release should fit onto C:\temp The entire release could be near 30GB or more....
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Right click drag the vx.x release folder from the P:\condor\public\binaries window to the C:\temp window. When you get the little menu after releasing the mouse button, select "Copy Here".
   <strong>
    DO NOT
   </strong>
   select move.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   This copying process for the stripped and unstripped binary release of HTCondor can take 70-90 minutes due to the amount being copied and the fact it is frmo AFS and the network to a local drive.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Close the P:\condor\public\binaries window.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Do start -&gt; run -&gt; P:\condor\public\cgi-bin\source\tarballs
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Right click drag, in the same manner as the above the current source tarball release of HTCondor for the revision you are archiving to the C:\temp window. Again,
   <strong>
    DO NOT
   </strong>
   move the file, just copy it.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Close the P:\condor\public\cgi-bin\source\tarballs window.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Do start -&gt; run -&gt; P:\condor\public\binaries\glidein
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Right click drag, in the same manner as the above, the current glidein tarball releases of HTCondor for the revision you are archiving to the C:\temp window. Again,
   <strong>
    DO NOT
   </strong>
   move the file, just copy it.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Close the P:\condor\public\binaries\glidein window.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Do start -&gt; run -&gt; P:\condor\public\html\manual
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Right click drag, in the same manner as the above, the folder which contains the html tree and various forms of the manual for the desired HTCondor revision to the C:\temp window. Again,
   <strong>
    DO NOT
   </strong>
   move the directory, just copy it.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Rename this newly copied folder to "Documentation".
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Close the P:\condor\public\html\manual window.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Double click on your vx.x folder to enter it and select View -&gt; Arrange Icons by -&gt; Name
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Delete anything not related to the stripped binary distribution of HTCondor, the unstripped binary distribution of HTCondor, and any HTCondor source tarballs, for the version of HTCondor that you are wishing to commit to DVD. Often, there will be a lot of cruft in the vx.x directory you've copied. Make sure you are acutally deleting things out of the C:\temp\vx.x folder and not the original, which you should have closed by now. :)
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Do start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Nero 7 Ultra Edition -&gt; data -&gt; Nero Burning Rom
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Of course, if there is a different version of Nero use that, but it'll be a very similar path through the menus.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   When Nero starts up, it may provide you with a composition selection box, if not, then go to File -&gt; New to get one.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   While viewing the new composition selection box, in the upper left hand corner's pull down menu, select DVD. Then in the scrollable pane directly underneath it, ensure DVD-ROM(ISO) has been selected. All of the tabs on the right should be left at default. When done, click the "New" button.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Right click in the left side window of Nero's compilation window (in the area underneath the "Name" row). Create a vx.x.x folder for the particular revision of HTCondor you are archiving. Double click on that directory to enter it.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   WARNING: Nero's alphabetical ordering is different from the windows folder ordering. To get around this problem Just drag the files from the name-sorted C:\temp window as detailed in the following procedure (being careful not to disturb the C:\temp window in the middle of it):
   <p>
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Select a group of files from the top towards the bottom and drag them to the left side of Nero's window.
    </li>
    <li>
     Note the selection color in the C:\temp window. This will go from blue to a brownish-grey after the drag and the window goes out of focus.
    </li>
    <li>
     Use the previously highlighted selection as a guide for selecting the next group you need to burn.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   The free space bar at the bottom of the nero composition window will tell you how full the DVD is. Stay in the green region as this does not require dual layer disks, which you might or might not have been able to procure. Also the finished DVDs don't need dual layer drives to be able to read them when burned in this manner.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   After filling the DVD (in the composition area under "Name") with contiguously selected files (while trying to keep related packages on the same DVD) from C:\temp, click the Burn Icon.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   When the burn window comes up, check to make sure it is indeed for a DVD-ROM(ISO), and if so, simply click "Burn".
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Now, in this "writing to disc" window which has just shown up, check the checkbox "Verify written data" in the lower left hand side of the window. It is ok to do this at any time before the burn is finished. Writing to the DVD and verifying it can take ~15 minutes.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Click OK for the "data verificattion completed successfully" dialog box. Obviously, if the verification wasn't ok, then the DVD is a drink coaster.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   The DVD will now eject.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Remove the DVD and label it at least with the specific version of HTCondor you archived, stripped or unstripped, and as many architectures as you can write int the little amount of space you have. If the disc contains the source code, make mention of that specifically on the disk.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   If you require more DVD to burn all your flies, then put a new blank DVD in the drive and shut it. Don't forget to drag the "Documentation" folder onto one of the DVDs!
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Select File -&gt; Close in Nero.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Then restart the process with File -&gt; New until done.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   When all finished, exit Nero via File -&gt; Quit.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Then delete the C:\temp\vx.x directory and all of its contents.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Give the physical DVDs to the keeper of the DVDs, named at the top of this document.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Give extra DVDs (and probably the sharpie) back to Ken.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   You are done.
  </li>
 </ol>
