   Module Description
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  HTCondor View is used to automatically generate
World Wide Web (WWW) pages displaying usage statistics of your HTCondor
Pool.  Included in the module is a shell script that invokes the
condor_stats command to retrieve pool usage statistics from the
HTCondor View server and generate HTML pages from the results.

  Information and Installation
 </h2>
 <p>
  The HTCondor View Client Contrib Module is used to automatically generate
World Wide Web (WWW) pages displaying usage statistics of your HTCondor
Pool.  Included in the module is a shell script that invokes the
condor_stats command to retrieve pool usage statistics from the
HTCondor View server and generate HTML pages from the results.  Also
included is a Java applet that graphically visualizes HTCondor usage
information.  Users can interact with the applet to customize the
visualization, or to zoom-in to a specific time frame.
 </p>
 <p>
  After unpacking and installing the HTCondor View Client, a script named
"make_stats" can be invoked to create HTML pages displaying HTCondor usage
for the past hour, day, week, or month.  By using the Unix cron facility
to periodically execute make_stats, HTCondor pool usage statistics can be
kept up to date automatically.  This simple model allows the HTCondor View
Client to be installed easily; no Web server CGI interface is needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***   To install the HTCondor View Client:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. First, make certain that you have configured your pool's
condor_collector (typically running on the central manager) to log
information to disk in order to provide a persistent, historical
database of pool statistics.  The HTCondor View client makes queries over
the network against this database.   To
activate the persistent database logging, add the following entries into
the condor_config files on your central manager:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>    POOL_HISTORY_DIR = /full/path/to/directory/to/store/historical/data
    KEEP_POOL_HISTORY = True
</pre>
 <p>
  For full details, see the HTCondor Manual, in
the section "condor_collector Config File Entries".
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Create a directory where you would like HTCondor View to create the HTML
files.  This directory should be one published by a web server, so
that HTML files which exist in this directory can be accessed via a web
browser.  We will refer to this directory as the VIEWDIR directory.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Unpack/untar  the HTCondor View Client contrib module file "view_client.tgz"
into the VIEWDIR.  This will create several files and subdirectories in the
VIEWDIR.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Edit the file "make_stats".  At the top of this file are six
parameters you need to customize.  The parameters are:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   ORGNAME : Set ORGNAME to be a very brief name to identify your
	  organization, for example "Univ of Wisconsin".  Do not use any
	  slashes in the name or other special regular-expression
	  characters, i.e. avoid characters like: / \ ^ $.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   CONDORADMIN : Set CONDORADMIN to be the email address of the
	  Condor administrator at your site.  This email address will appear
	  at the bottom of the web pages.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   VIEWDIR : Set VIEWDIR to the full pathname (
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   a relative path)
	  to the VIEWDIR directory you selected in installation step 2
	  above.  It is the same directory where the make_stats file lives.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   STATSDIR : Set STATSDIR to be the full pathname to the
   <em>
    directory
   </em>
   which contains the condor_stats binary.  The condor_stats program
	  is included in the bin directory with HTCondor version 6.1 and
	  above.  The value for
	  STATSDIR is added to the PATH parameter by default; see below.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   PATH : Set PATH so be a list of subdirectories, separated by
	  colons, where the make_stats script can find awk, bc, sed, date,
	  and condor_stats programs.  If you have perl installed on this
	  system, set the path to include the directory where perl is
	  installed as well.  Using the below default works on most systems:
	  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:$STATSDIR:/usr/local/bin
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  5. Now type "./make_stats setup".  This will create all of the initial HTML
files.  Open up the file "index.html" with your web browser and verify
things look good.
 </p>
 <p>
  6. Add the make_stats program to cron.  Running "make_stats setup" in
step 5 should have created a "cronentries" file.  This cronentries file
is ready to be processed by your Unix system's crontab command.  Enter
"man crontab" on your system if you are not familiar with the crontab
command and/or the cron daemon.  Take a look at the cronentries file; by
default, it will run "make_stats hour" every 15 minutes, "make_stats
day" once an hour, "make_stats week" twice per day, and "make_stats
month" once per day.  These are reasonable defaults.  You can add these
commands to cron on any system that can access to the VIEWDIR and
STATSDIR, even on a system that does not have HTCondor installed.  The
commands do not have to run as user root either; in fact, they should
probably not run as root.  These commands can run as any user that has
read/write access to the VIEWDIR.  To add these commands to cron, enter:
   crontab cronentries
 </p>
 <p>
  7. If you have one or more checkpoint servers, you can use HTCondor View
to display statistics about them.  For instructions, see the INSTALL
file in the "ckptserver" subdirectory.
 </p>
 <p>
  8. That's it!  Point your web browser at the VIEWDIR directory, and you
should be all set.
