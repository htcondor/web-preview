  <h2>
   How to perform a code review
  </h2>
 </span>
 <p>
  Here are the steps to take to perform a good code review in HTCondor.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Upon completion of the code review, add a pithy remark to the appropriate gittrac ticket with your thoughts. This will allow someone to discover by reading the ticket (a) if a code review was performed, (b) who did the review, (c) when the review happened, and (d) what the reviewer discovered.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Ask the author if regression tests are not too cost
  prohibitive to test the feature/fix. If not, then they
   <strong>
    must
   </strong>
   exist.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   The author must have Purify'ied or valground the codebase
  (bonus points if they can do it while also running
  regression tests) and have fixed anything suspicious.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Schedule a set time with the author to perform the code
  review. Be aware that a large code review (1000+ lines)
  could take 16 hours or more to do.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Learn at a high level why/where the change/addition is
  being made: What problem does it fix? What assumptions
  does it make? What are its limitations?  What branch
  is the code on and is that the right place for it? Why
  are the new files (if any) named the way they are and
  should they be named in such a manner (easier to fix
  before adding to cvs)?
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Have the author explain in plain english the code changes
  while visually walking the code. Listen for inconsistancies
  between what is said and what is read.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Inspect the code line by line with reasonable effort to
  determine correctness or correct obvious mistakes. Ask
  questions especially concerning error handling and look
  for opportunities for defensive programming. Correct
  gross coding conventions errors, simplify overly complex
  branch code, add debugging output where necessary, refactor
  common internal code
   <strong>
    before
   </strong>
   it gets merged
  into mainline codes.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   If the code duplicates large sections of other codes, or
  reimplements functions from some utility library. That
   <strong>
    must
   </strong>
   be factored out of the codebase
  for maintenance purposes unless there is a very good
  reason why it can't.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Ensure the code compiles on the correct platforms
  (using NMI) and is bracketed with #ifdefs if needed for
  conditional compilation and passes the current regression
  test suite.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Hand test the feature/code fixes which were too cost
  prohibitive to implement regressions tests and ensure it
  does what is advertised. For example, if the code path was
  to alter the output of condor_status in some manner, run
  condor_status and see if the output is modified properly.
  Test edge cases--especially where user input or control
  must happen.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   If the code/feature changes are visible to a user,
  ensure that all related documentation in the manual is
  up to date and sufficiently detailed to explain the new
  feature/bug fix.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Carefully inspect diffs of the codebase against the place
  it is being merged to ensure nothing is being changed that
  shouldn't be and it plays well with surrounding codes.
  If the code requires a new external. Ensure
