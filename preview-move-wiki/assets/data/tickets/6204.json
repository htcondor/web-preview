I think that we'd have to add some new events, but I'm not 100% sure, so I'll check.\n\n</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that submit files that queue a large number of jobs can reduce the effectiveness of such a throttle similarly to maxidle, for example.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Mar-24 16:59:22 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, there are (not-yet-used) provisions for a STAGE_IN_EVENT and STAGE_OUT_EVENT -- presumably those would be what we would need for this...</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Mar-24 16:59", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Mar-24 16:39", "fixed_version": "2017-Mar-24 16:39", "broken_version": "v080700", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
