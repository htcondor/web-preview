{"id": 6357, "title": "Ticket #6357: Transmit submit digest to schedd as text to be spooled", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs part of late materialization milestone 2 - we should transmit the submit digest to the schedd as a text blob and have the schedd write it into the spool directory.   This will save the schedd the work of reading it from disk on submit, and also reduce the likelihood of user error causing factories to fail to load on restart.\n\n<p>We will follow the same pattern that the schedd uses for spooled executables for spooling the submit digest. The file will be named\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">$(SPOOL)/$INT(ClusterId%10000)/condor_submit.$(ClusterId).digest</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This change also opens up the possibility  that the schedd will write the digest into the job queue log rather than writing it to a separate file, but for this milestone, a file will be used.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Aug-02 12:01</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=51981\">[51981]</a></span>: have the schedd write spool the submit digest file for -factory jobs. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6357\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6357'); return false;\" title=\"Transmit submit digest to schedd as text to be spooled\">#6357</a></span> this is part of late materialization milestone 2.
