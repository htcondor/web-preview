{"id": 3622, "title": "Ticket #3622: RFE: condor co-scheduling with openstack", "description": "<blockquote>\nSo an idea I've had running around my head, now that brianb has exposed the .py bindings, was: \"What if we were to overload a Openstack nova-scheduler driver to use condor as a co-scheduler to \"share\" a cluster and play nicely together.\"\n\n<p>Openstack is written in python and is very extensible, at almost every layer one can override and configure their own optimized widget.  One such place, is the nova-scheduler.driver, which basically chooses the resource where openstack can schedule it's job.  Using condors .py extensions one could craft a constraint query that would enable the nova-scheduler to choose resources based on that constraint (of which there could be many).  There are a number of other things we could integrating the two, but it I figured I would start the percolating process here.\n\n</p><p>Ref of CERN &amp; Openstack:\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/150000-cloud-virtual-machines-will-help-solve-mysteries-of-the-universe/\">http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/150000-cloud-virtual-machines-will-help-solve-mysteries-of-the-universe/</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-May-14 11:42:24 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nDoes the nova-controller have a concept of queueing requests?  Or do we have to fulfill the requests \"immediately\" (for some value of immediate)?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-14 13:04:06 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nEverything is entered into a configurable queue, where the schedulers can opportunistically schedule jobs from that queue.

IIRC that is actually handled in nova-scheduler, I'm still learning about openstack so I'll definitely need a bit of time to get up to speed on it.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jul-08 17:09", "status": "new", "created": "2013-May-14 10:10", "fixed_version": "2013-May-14 10:10", "broken_version": "v070906", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tstclair", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com, tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
