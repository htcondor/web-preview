It would not be hard to make it less confusing.\n\n<p>From RUST #21737, here is an extract from the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StarterLog\" title=\"Starter Log\">StarterLog</a></span> which <strong>almost</strong> helps the user:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>03/01 10:52:23 Submitting machine is \"mansun\"\n03/01 10:52:23 setting the orig job name in starter\n03/01 10:52:23 setting the orig job iwd in starter\n03/01 10:52:23 ERROR: the submitting host claims to be in our UidDomain (wrc.xerox.com),\nyet its hostname (mansun) does not match.

It could look something like this when successful:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>03/01 10:52:23 Submitting machine is \"mansun\"\n03/01 10:52:23 setting the orig job name in starter\n03/01 10:52:23 setting the orig job iwd in starter\n03/01 10:52:23 Attempting to change from user \"root\" to user \"roy\"\n03/01 10:52:23 Now running as user \"roy\"\n03/01 10:52:23 Job 12.4 set to execute immediately\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>And it could like this when it failed:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>03/01 10:52:23 Submitting machine is \"mansun\"\n03/01 10:52:23 setting the orig job name in starter\n03/01 10:52:23 setting the orig job iwd in starter\n03/01 10:52:23 Attempting to change from user \"root\" to user \"roy\"\n03/01 10:52:23 ERROR: Failed to change from user \"root\" to user \"roy\" because the submitting\nhost claims to be in our UidDomain (wrc.xerox.com), yet its hostname (mansun) does not match.\nIf the above hostname is actually an IP address, Condor could not perform a reverse DNS lookup\n to convert the IP back into a name.

It might be too late for 7.6.0, but I think it's a good change to consider for 7.6.1 because it will help us debug problems more quickly and solve RUST tickets more quickly.\n\n</p><p>Thanks!</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-29 12:54", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Mar-03 15:58", "fixed_version": "2011-Mar-03 15:58", "broken_version": "v070505", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "roy", "rust": "a21737", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "roy@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
