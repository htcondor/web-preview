{"id": 3115, "title": "Ticket #3115: Slow Condor tests when hostname != FQDN.", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis stems from a problem where tests on exec-13 would run slowly enough to cause time-out failures.  This problem started on the same day as the upgrade from RH 6.2 to 6.3, but may have been only tangentially related.  One symptom (or perhaps cause) of the slow tests was the personal condor reporting slots as slot1@exec-13, not slot1@exec-13.batlab.org, as the main/C1 Condor -- the one reporting the BaTLab collector -- was doing.  We were unable to isolate the problem, but examining the 32-bit version of the same platform revealed that its /etc/sysconfig/network file was setting the hostname to the FQDN.  Making this change and rebooting exec-13 corrected the symptom; TJ will know shortly if it corrected the slowness as well.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Jul-10 15:18:19 by kronenfe:</em> <br/>\n\nSpecifically, the exact change we made was in /etc/sysconfig/network Ken changed the line:\n\n<p>HOSTNAME=exec-13\n\n</p><p>to:\n\n</p><p>HOSTNAME=exec-13.batlab.org\n\n</p><p>Apparently this was already one on our RH6.3 32-bit machine which is how he figured out what to do.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3116\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3116'); return false;\" title=\"[proposal] Condor should try harder to obtain an FQDN.\">#3116</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n[proposal] Condor should try harder to obtain an FQDN.</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3117\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3117'); return false;\" title=\"Why is Condor slow when hostname != FQDN?\">#3117</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nWhy is Condor slow when hostname != FQDN?</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2012-Jul-11 14:41", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jul-09 17:27", "fixed_version": "2012-Jul-09 17:27", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
