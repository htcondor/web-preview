It sets the appropriate environment variables so that its children will use the rewritten values. This is used for glide-in, so that multiple glide-ins to the same cluster can automatically have different log, spool, and execute directories.\n\n<p>It appears each time the daemon receives a reconfig (via either condor_reconfig or SIGHUP), it will append another copy of the IP and pid to LOG, SPOOL, and EXECUTE, and start using the new values.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Mar-18 10:36:48 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed a fix to V7_4-branch.\n\n<p>Now, the modified LOG, SPOOL, and EXECUTE values are left untouched on a reconfig. This means that a change of these parameters in the config file will be ignored. This keeps the daemon's handling of these parameters the same as its children, which never see changes of the values in the config file.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Mar-18 10:23</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/c662d3490cd6971cdff84faf014345fb380c523a\">[17661]</a></span>: Dynamic directory names no longer reappended on reconfig. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=92\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('92'); return false;\" title=\"Dynamic directory names appended on reconfig\">#92</a></span> If a daemon is given -d on the command line, it modified the values of LOG, SPOOL, and EXECUTE by appending its IP address and pid.
