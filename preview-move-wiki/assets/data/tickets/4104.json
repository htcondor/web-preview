(I'm pretty sure this is significantly slower than it used to be, but unfortunately I don't have specific records.)  Also, this is running with the log file on local disk, so it's not a matter of AFS slowness or something like that.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Dec-06 16:51:00 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, it's the condor_fsync() when writing events that is the problem.  Pretty reliably, about every fifth to tenth one takes about a whole second(!).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Dec-09 10:13:30 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOh, yeah -- this is on RHEL 6.4.  I wonder if RHEL 5 didn't have this problem (or at least it wasn't as bad) -- if that's true, it would explain why the test used to be faster...  (Unfortunately, I don't remember whether the slowdown happened at the same time my desktop machine was switched to RHEL 6.)\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Dec-09 17:51:29 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, I changed the create_large_dag script to turn off fsyncing of the user log file(s).  That at least fixes things for the test, although it doesn't fix the underlying problem.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Dec-09 15:47</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=38961\">[38961]</a></span>: Gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4104\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4104'); return false;\" title=\"Really large DAG test (DAG-level NOOP jobs) are too slow\">#4104</a></span>: Turned off user event log file syncing for \"large\" and \"really large\" DAG tests -- makes them run ~20 times faster.
