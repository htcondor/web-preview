This is useful if you're running condor_annex from that host, or that host is a CM, but actively harmful otherwise, because you would expect to be able to set CONDOR_HOST and not have to change COLLECTOR_HOST.  Not sure what do about this.  Maybe just document it where CONDOR_HOST is normally set?\n\n<p>The user confirms they pulled the AMI they were using out of the Marketplace.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:46:37 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080906 to v080907 using ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:27", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Sep-11 14:53", "fixed_version": "2019-Sep-11 14:53", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Annex", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
