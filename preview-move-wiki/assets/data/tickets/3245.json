Further explanation would be appreciated. But let me explain what I did.\n\n<p>I installed SL6 (6.3) from a live CD on a virtual machine. I used <code>yum</code> to install <code>openmpi</code>, V.1.5.4. I then built the current development version of Condor (7.9.2 pre-release) on the virtual machine. After having to install numerous other packages and having to play around with the configuration script, Condor finally installed.\n\n</p><p>The <code>openmpiscript</code> example file works just fine and the sample scripts listed in <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/condor-users/2012-August/msg00119.shtml\">this message</a> did not work well. After some modification (namely removing the machine file information and the MCA part), I got it to work.\n\n</p><p>What versions of SL6, openmpi, and Condor did you use?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Oct-24 16:08:58 by samf:</em> <br/>\n\nTim and I both agree that the <code>openmpi</code> script is fine. As for <code>MPICH2</code>, I have a working script now provided I am using MPICH2 Version 1.5.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Oct-25 17:52:16 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070806 to v070807 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Oct-26 09:52:08 by samf:</em> <br/>\n\nThe OpenMPI script works just fine.

I've asked to see her log files so I can figure out what is going on.  All I know is that we have a problem with sshd.sh given the return value of 255. But I don't know what the exact problem is because sshd.sh has four error cases and the information given is insufficient for me to determine the problem.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-28 14:53:36 by samf:</em> <br/>\n\nI heard back from Vivien.\n\n<p>Juan Barayoga at Caltech gave me a solution that worked.\n\n</p><p>1.

How do we get MPI jobs to work in the Parallel Universe to run without manually pre-installing the extra user credentials that Juan setup for Vivien?\n\n<p>I.e., is it by design that we need to manually set up ssh login authorization to every compute node for a user in order for MPI to work for them?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-05 14:02:02 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nThe design is that the keys should NOT have to be set up a-priori.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-28 17:16:00 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070808 to v070809 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-14 14:26:26 by samf:</em> <br/>\n\nGiven the error message previously obtained, I suspect that this is a problem when the keys get transferred around as the problem went away when the keys were transferred in another way. We should change the exit codes in <code>sshd.sh</code> so that we can distinguish what is going on. Additionally, if we had the regular stdout of the code, we might be able to diagnose what is going on since <code>sshd.sh</code> prints the actual error message to stdout, not strderr.\n\n<p>Greg mentioned that we might want to consider using <code>condor_ssh_to_job</code> to transfer the keys around instead of using <code>sshd.sh</code>.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-20 14:41:36 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nGreg, can we have an update on this ticket?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Sep-03 11:15:53 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nI've rerun my tests on SL6 here at UW, and things seem to work with openmpi.
