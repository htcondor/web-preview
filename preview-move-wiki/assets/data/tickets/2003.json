It's pretty easy to determine the serial port assigned to the VM via libvirt, especially if you're root.\n\n<p>The part is how to grant the user privileges to talk to it (and only that port!).  Best I could figure is use a pipe through a process that is started with root privs.  Doesn't seem to be either elegant or simple though.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-31 07:43:45 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://libvirt.org/remote.html\">http://libvirt.org/remote.html</a>\ne.g. qemu+ssh://user@system.com - opens a channel for VNC terminals to be displayed.
