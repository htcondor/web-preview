Reading it gives me the impression that\n&gt; RANK will effect matchmaking while the slot is idle\n&gt; (which it may?

The situation is the following:\n &gt;\n &gt; - There are submitted jobs that have high machine rank so they are\n &gt; supposed to start as soon as slots are available.\n &gt; - There are available slots that match the job requirements, condor_q\n &gt; analyze confirms that, but other users' lower ranked jobs get matched to\n &gt; these slots.\n\n</p><p>Setting the startd rank (i.e. RANK = .... in condor_config) does not\ncontrol how fast slots get matched, nor does it prevent lower ranked\njobs from getting matched to those slots.\n\n</p><p>What startd rank DOES do is tells the startd \"if possible, preempt and\nreplace the currently running job with a higher ranked idle job\".\nEssentially, it is a way for the machine to rank how much it likes the\njob it is currently matched with, and tells the condor_negotiator to\nkeep looking for a match it likes better than its current one.\n\n</p><p>So if a machine has an unclaimed slot, it will first be offered to the\nhighest priority user (regardless of startd RANK).  Once the slot is\nclaimed by the highest priority user with a job that matches the slot,\nstartd RANK kicks in and the condor_negotiator will continue to look to\nsee if there are jobs from a different user that RANK higher - if so,\nthe job from the highest priority user will be preempted and replaced\nwith the job that ranks higher.\n\n</p><p>Note that startd RANK always implies preemption- if you don't want job\nto be preempted, startd rank does not help you.\n\n</p><p>If you want to control who gets \"first shot\" at a slot, you would\nnormally adjust user priorities (aka condor_userprio -setfactor\nuser@domain 1) or group quotas.\n\n</p><p>If you want to increase the frequency at which matchmaking occurs (it\nonly happens every NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL seconds, or when someone run\ncondor_submit, condor_reschedule), decrease NEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL.\n\n</p><p>Hope the above helps,\nTodd</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Dec-01 09:17:52 by wenger:</em>\n\n<p></p><pre>  ... except that the default NEGOTIATOR_PRE_JOB_RANK includes\nMy.Rank, which according to the manual, refers to the machine rank, not\nthe job rank.
