The section announces itself as included for reference and outdated, but it is time (as agreed by Greg) to remove the section.  Removal is being done on the master, such that it will appear in the next stable series.  Current stable series should not have a feature change as this will appear to be.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nHopefully purged the MPI universe completely from the manual.
