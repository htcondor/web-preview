The documentation says that all smpds must use the\nsame port?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Mar-24 17:36:34 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is interesting:\n\n<p>The Folding@home SMP client initially used the MPICH2 implementation of MPI for the Linux, Mac OS X and Windows SMP clients, to enable multiple Folding@home cores to cooperate. Since v5.92 the Windows client stopped using MPICH2 in favor of DeinoMPI which runs much more reliable on Windows (like MPICH2 does on Linux and Mac OS X). The Linux &amp; Mac OS X clients still use MPICH2.
