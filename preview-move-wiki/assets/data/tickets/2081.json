{"id": 2081, "title": "Ticket #2081: rpm init / boot script bugs related to status and shutdown requests", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe rpm boot init script status request (aka \"/sbin/service condor status\") always reports Condor inactive, and a shutdown request does not report failure if there was a timeout shutting down Condor.\n\n<p>Looks like the problems stems from <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1997\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1997'); return false;\" title=\"init script should create /var/run/condor\">#1997</a></span> commit <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=21144\">[21144]</a></span>, which changed the signature for function condor_master_pids. Previously it returned the master pids via an echo to stdout, now instead it uses a global variable to store the results.  Why using a global variable here is preferable is opaque to me -- there is no wisdom re why this was changed in the commit message, or in comments in the script, or in the ticket :(.  The bug appears to be that most of the call sites were changed, but a few were missed.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Apr-21 16:27:18 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed patch into V7_6-branch.
