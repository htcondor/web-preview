As a result, you can't easily go backward and forward.\n\n<p>Similarly, when you click on a row in a table, modifying the linked graph, no URL change.\n\n</p><p>Both should update the URL in a way that allows bookmarking and going back and forward.\n\n</p><p>This could be through manipulating the history directly, probably by manipulating the search arguments. There is some old commented out code in htcondorview.js for doing this. (index.html?foo=bar)\n\n</p><p>The other option is manipulating document.location directly with anchors (index.html#foo=bar); that should allow the history to just work.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Nov-11 14:30", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Nov-11 14:30", "fixed_version": "2015-Nov-11 14:30", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5351", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
