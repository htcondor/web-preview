{"id": 1327, "title": "Ticket #1327: Improve logging for grid monitor", "description": "<blockquote>\nLogging for the grid monitor needs to be improved. Stdout of the grid monitor job is saved in an obscure location and removed when an error occurs or the job exits. In the event of errors, some or all of this output should be saved in a more permanent and prominent location, probably the gridmanager's log. The grid monitor job's stderr should be similarly logged.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Oct-19 12:03", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2010-Apr-01 11:33", "fixed_version": "2010-Apr-01 11:33", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
