Currently I\nthink some of the documentation assumes you are coming from the last\nDevelopment release.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Aug-15 11:26:26 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nWith the recent release of 8.2.0, the new and improved section on 'Upgrading from the 8.0 to the 8.2 series of HTCondor' likely addresses this request.  Therefore, abandoning the ticket.  The task is completed, but without any commits that can be associated with the ticket.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2014-Aug-15 11:27", "status": "defer", "created": "2013-Jun-19 13:21", "fixed_version": "2013-Jun-19 13:21", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, anderson@ligo.caltech.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
