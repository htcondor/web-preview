{"id": 3962, "title": "Ticket #3962: Add file-transfer plugin for HDFS", "description": "<blockquote>\nHDFS might be a nice way to deal with large input files.  We presently only \"support\" it if it's mounted (via FUSE) and the submitter knows where, and thinks to use file:// URLs.  This is suboptimal, not least because Nate doesn't trust FUSE.  It should not be difficult to write a file-transfer plugin which uses (or natively speaks) the HDFS protocol to copy from HDFS to the execute directory.\n\n<p>This issue particularly affects VM universe, because it is not possible to provide a wrapper script to use HDFS natively, because there is no executable.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Oct-02 15:39", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Oct-02 15:39", "fixed_version": "2013-Oct-02 15:39", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "FileTransfer", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "cat@cs.wisc.edu, tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, bbockelm@cse.unl.edu, bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
