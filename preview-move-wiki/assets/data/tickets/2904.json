The problem is that file1 gets chowned and then the switchboard fails to verify that file2 is a symlink or is already chowned, because it first tries to open the file as the source user, which is no longer allowed.\n\n</p><p>Another case that fails is if there is a directory in the sandbox that does not have execute permission for the owner of the directory.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Nov-08 17:10:10 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI pushed a patch for the problems with links.  That's the case that affected our users.  The other case (a directory without the execute bit set) is tricky.  For now, I think we should consider this expected behavior: jobs that produce such sandboxes will go on hold.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-17 12:45:49 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nagreed w/ dan.  if job creates directories that are not owner-traversible, the job will go on hold.  we could modify the switchboard if we think this is a problem in reality.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Nov-08 16:56</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=34060\">[34060]</a></span>: Fixed privsep sandbox chown errors when there are links to private files. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2904\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2904'); return false;\" title=\"privsep fails when sandbox contains permission issues\">#2904</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Dec-17 12:46", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Mar-26 11:21", "fixed_version": "2012-Mar-26 11:21", "broken_version": "v070705", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
