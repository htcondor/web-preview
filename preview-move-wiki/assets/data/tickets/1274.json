Of 1458 machines,\n   1228 are rejected by your job's requirements\n    160 match but are serving users with a better priority in the pool\n    [other output elided]\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>It turns out there is no easy way. It would be <strong>very useful</strong> if we could since it'll make debugging complex problems like \"why is this better priority user not having more jobs than a worse priority user and it has been in this stable state for several days.\" much easier to debug.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Jun-01 13:56:15 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nIt was found that greg thain independently did the work associated with this ticket.
