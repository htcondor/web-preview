{"id": 1793, "title": "Ticket #1793: IpVerify::PunchHole() doesn't work without specific IP address", "description": "<blockquote>\nIpVerify::PunchHole() is used to make internal adjustments to the authorization policy that we think should be automatic.  Currently, it supports authorization by IP or by fqu@IP.  There are two cases where it is being used to authorize fqu (at any IP), but since this is not supported, these adjustments to the authorization policy have no effect and we instead rely on the authorization policy defined by the user to allow access.  The two cases are: 1) <code>DaemonCore::Inherit()</code> authorizing the parent security session and 2) <code>CStarter::createJobOwnerSecSession()</code> used by ssh_to_job.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Dec-02 11:39</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/bc8cc34f491927dd4964c18bce2f1b125f1a9ebd\">[19516]</a></span>: IpVerify::PunchHole() now supports authorizing a user at any IP. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1793\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1793'); return false;\" title=\"IpVerify::PunchHole() doesn't work without specific IP address\">#1793</a></span> Previously, it only supported fqu@IP or IP.
