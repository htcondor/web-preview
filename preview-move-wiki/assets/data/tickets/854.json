{"id": 854, "title": "Ticket #854: VMUniverseMgr::docheckVMUniverse takes a long time to fail", "description": "<blockquote>\nAfter upgrading to the 7.4.0 pre-release, there has been one case where the startd was killed by the master because it was unresponsive (c143.chtc.wisc.edu).  It was inside VMUniverseMgr::docheckVMUniverse() for about 40 minutes.  Looking through logs, I see that on some machines (including c143) the periodic VMUniverse check commonly takes up to 2.5 minutes.  This is a fairly large fraction of the 10 minutes between checks, so this is a little worrisome.\n\n<p>I'm assuming something is broken with the VMware setup on these machines, but if this is a common case, Condor should probably protect itself better.\n\n</p><p>When I manually run the check, it takes a while and then fails like this:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">$ /usr/sbin/condor_vm_vmware.pl check\nError: The system returned an error. Communication with the virtual machine may have been interrupted.\nError: The system returned an error.
