Maybe it would also get the idle jobs to eventually run.  (To make sure the \"monitor\" job runs first, we could have PRE scripts for all of the other jobs that wait for the \"monitor\" job to run before continuing.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Oct-28 16:35:23 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nNote:  We should test various ways of jobs becoming idle and non-idle (e.g., held/released, job finishes, job is removed).</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Oct-28 12:45</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/d1e5e1ff39e4b6aeee5e8f0c32f47ec56730434c\">[46129]</a></span>: Gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"stalled\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=5345\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5345'); return false;\" title=\"Create DAGMan maxidle test(s)\">#5345</a></span>: Starting on maxidle tests -- I have a couple of DAGs that demonstrate problems when run manually, but I don't have things set up yet to automatically detect pass/fail.
