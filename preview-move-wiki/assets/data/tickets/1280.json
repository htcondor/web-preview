{"id": 1280, "title": "Ticket #1280: Gram jobmanager version command doesn't work in most cases", "description": "<blockquote>\nGram's jobmanager version command doesn't work in most cases. The gram client library explicitly disables proxy delegation for this command. This causes the jobmanager to fail on start-up when it attempts to acquire a proxy (as it wants the delegated one). This causes the jobmanager to close the connection to the client without sending a reply. This results in a gram error 10 being returned to the caller. All versions of the jobmanager do this, so the client can't even determine if the jobmanager is GRAM2 or GRAM5.\n\n<p>If the server has a proxy for the mapped user in the default location in /tmp, the jobmanager is able to start up properly and either send back a valid reply (GRAM5) or an error 91 (GRAM2). This will normally not happen.\n\n</p><p>A simple fix would be to allow delegation of the proxy for the version command. The change would have to be made inside the gram client library. If a fix isn't available from Globus in time for 7.5.2, we should patch the version of Globus we build for Condor to include this change.\n\n</p><p>More information is available here: <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://jira.globus.org/browse/GRAM-141\">http://jira.globus.org/browse/GRAM-141</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Apr-12 11:04:43 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nIf the version command returns gram error 10, the gridmanager assumes the server is GRAM5, which will often be a wrong assumption.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Apr-13 09:43:15 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nUpdate Globus external to 5.0.1, which fixes this problem.
