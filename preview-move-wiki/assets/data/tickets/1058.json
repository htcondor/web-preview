Users have no way to know what is in the internal ad produced by Scheduler::publish().  The condor manual sort of hints that these expressions are evaluated in the context of the schedd ad, which is not true.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Aug-23 17:07:50 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070402 to v070404 using ./ticket_target_mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-27 16:39:01 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070404 to v070405 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Oct-27 16:39", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Dec-14 12:16", "fixed_version": "2009-Dec-14 12:16", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
