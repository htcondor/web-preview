{"id": 164, "title": "Ticket #164: Log rotation tests timing out", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe log rotation tests are timing out; I had previously thought that it was entirely an issue with the tests, but, after solving those problems, I'm still seeing problems on 64-bit machines.  I've been able to reproduce it on my openSUSE 11.1 laptop, and I think it's likely that there's a real performance problem in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=UserLog\" title=\"User Log\">UserLog</a></span> -- I don't know for certain yet that it's not in the test program, but I think it's unlikely.  I also don't know yet whether the problem goes away with log rotation turned off.  I need to do some profiling to understand the problem better.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jun-01 11:44:08 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\n<span class=\"section\"><h2>Summary as of 1 June 2009</h2></span>\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>Details\n<ul>\n<li>In the test results for the past month, there has been a total of 10 timeouts\n<ul>\n<li>4 on the trunk\n</li><li>6 on V7-2\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p></li><li>All of these failures are in -defaults test\n<ul>\n<li>Last trunk failure: 16 May 2009\n</li><li>Last V7_2 failure: 20 May 2009\n</li><li><strong>All</strong> of these failures have been on \"nmi:x86 64_fc_9\" \"Cross of nmi:x86 64_rhap_5\".\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p></li><li>Trunk\n<ul>\n<li>There have been no related code changes in the time window between the last failure and the stretch of successes\n</li><li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://nmi-s006.cs.wisc.edu/results/Test-history.php?branch=trunk&amp;test=lib_eventlog_rotation-defaults-1\">NMI Test Results</a>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p></li><li>V7_2-branch\n<ul>\n<li>There were some changes to the user log code during this window.
