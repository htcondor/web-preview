{"id": 3256, "title": "Ticket #3256: Implement Negotiator-Schedd protocol extension for global jobprios", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs a development milestone in support of honoring job priorities across multiple schedds, modify the Schedd to honor a protocol extension.\nThe Negotiator-Schedd protocol will be extended to include a request for \"only jobs from user X and with job priorities between Y and Z inclusive\" (as opposed to the current \"only jobs from user X\").  To ensure backwards/forwards wire compatibility, this is accomplished via two new attributes (<code>JOBPRIO_MIN</code> and <code>JOBPRIO_MAX</code>) in the classad exchanged between the negotiator and schedd at the start of negotiation.\n\n<p>See the parent ticket for the design document and further details.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Oct-08 14:32:17 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nNote - this is an implementation milestone ticket.
