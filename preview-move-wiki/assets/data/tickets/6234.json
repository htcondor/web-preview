{"id": 6234, "title": "Ticket #6234: Allow blahp to find batch system tools in the PATH", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe blahp's scripts require a configuration variable be set saying where the batch system's comand-line tools reside (e.g. <code>condor_binpath</code>). This assumes all of the tools reside in the same directory. This is not true with OSG-Connect. It includes a wrapper script for condor_submit, which resides in a directory that's earlier in the PATH than the real condor_submit binary.\n\n<p>We should change the blahp's scripts so that if the binpath variable for the batch system is unset, they rely on the PATH to find each command-line tool.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2017-Apr-26 10:28", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Apr-26 10:28", "fixed_version": "2017-Apr-26 10:28", "broken_version": "v080400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "a31651", "customer_group": "support", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
