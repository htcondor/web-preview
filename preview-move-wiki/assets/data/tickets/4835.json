This should be causing the listen() call to fail, but we're not seeing that.  This requires further investigation, and may imply that the master is the only daemon which binds to specific ports (when spawning daemon core daemons) and using a different code path, in which case we can probably just remove this one entirely.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Feb-02 11:07:18 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nSock::listen() is gratuitously overloaded, and the other implementation calls bind() for you.  <strong>sigh</strong></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Feb-02 11:07", "status": "resolved", "created": "2015-Jan-20 15:24", "fixed_version": "2015-Jan-20 15:24", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
