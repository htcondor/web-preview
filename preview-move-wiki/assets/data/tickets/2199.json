{"id": 2199, "title": "Ticket #2199: Inconsistent job status for gt2 jobs between condor-g and ce", "description": "<blockquote>\nUCSD is reporting that jobs marked running in their Condor-G queue were in fact idle at several CEs using Condor. The problem appears to be caused by the jobs becoming held on the CE. GRAM ignores hold events when determining a job's state. GRAM also makes no attempt to release or remove held jobs, so absent admin-set system periodic expressions, held jobs will remain held forever, with their status reported as running (or possibly idle) to the client.\n\n<p>More details here: <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/SelfService/Display.html?id=9237\">http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/SelfService/Display.html?id=9237</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Aug-02 14:31:13 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nAdditional problems have been reported with 'reconnect failed' events. GRAM ignores these events and will consequently report jobs as running when they are idle. Treating these events as 'evict' events doesn't work, as we are seeing more 'reconnect failed' events than 'executing' events for many jobs.\n\n<p>The GRAM perl code needs to be overhauled to look at what event appears last in the Condor user log.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Feb-11 20:29:21 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nUCSD has since switched to HTCondor-CE; abandoning this for now.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2015-Feb-11 20:29", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2011-May-27 11:44", "fixed_version": "2011-May-27 11:44", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
