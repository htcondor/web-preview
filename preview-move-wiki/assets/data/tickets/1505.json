{"id": 1505, "title": "Ticket #1505: Checkpoint Server REQUEST_TIMEOUT should be a knob", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe checkpoint server has a very short hard coded 5 second timeout when waiting for the shadow to talk to it. On a burdened submit machine, it could be possible that the shadows can't complete their initial packet write in 5 seconds and when this happens the ckpt server cuts the connection resulting in a shadow exception.\n\n<p>It gets worse in that if there are many shadows doing this, 5 seconds of wasted\nconnections are being held, stopping valid xfers from occurring.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:08:44 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:09", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Jul-15 14:26", "fixed_version": "2010-Jul-15 14:26", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Std", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu mick@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
