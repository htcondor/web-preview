It would take as context a job ad, a match ad, and extra negotiator attributes (such as current quota usages and priorities, see V7.2 3.4.3).\n\n<p>How is this different from APPEND_REQUIREMENTS? It can be configured in one location to alter behavior, instead of on each Schedd plus a qedit for existing jobs. It would have access to attributes from V7.2's 3.4.3.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 14:50", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Mar-17 08:11", "fixed_version": "2009-Mar-17 08:11", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#216", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu,tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
