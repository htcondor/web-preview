This is especially egregious when specifying instance types with different core counts.  We should accept --cores (instead of --instaces) and convert internally, including when assigning instance type counts.  (Continue to assign round-robin, just do so with an increment of core-count, rather than 1.)\n\n<p>(This last will irritate a bunch of people, but we need to figure out our position on bidding and/or pricing cleverness before we do anything else.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Aug-25 11:25:07 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nAbandoning as specific to the prototype.
