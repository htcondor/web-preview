The idea that a \"controller\" operates on a pristine interface behind which lies an the actual Impl is super simple and would allow us to refactor code, and hook up new impls very easily.\n\n</p><p>The controller would isolate all the Daemon-core oddities and dependencies while the inteface &amp; impl only care about it's domain.  Right now the collector has a blending of knowledge, and the encapsulation boundaries and quite sloppy.\n\n</p><p>Who maintains the data?  who queries the data?  who handles communications?\n\n</p><p>You simply can't point to one object to answer any of those questions.\n\n</p><p>Also, upon re-inspection of makehash functions I agree with it's \"correctness\".</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Apr-05 13:53</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/4d20bdd98c1c24d83acf0b250a4781cb4e9c2f61\">[17783]</a></span>: Ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1328\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1328'); return false;\" title=\"minor fixes from code review of the collector.\">#1328</a></span> Minor updates and comments on a quick run through of the collector, post performance changes.
