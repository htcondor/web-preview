The authentication layer's identity gets mapped to a HTCondor identity, which subsequently goes into the job.\n</li><li>X.509 attributes.  <strong>If</strong> GSI is used, the following is copied forward:\n<ul>\n<li>DN\n</li><li>Email (if present)\n</li><li>VOMS attributes (if present)\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Additionally, you can provide job transforms such that some of these input attributes (such as VOMS info) get transformed into other arbitrary job attributes.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>Similarly, perhaps we should copy capabilities from an IDTOKEN and/or a SCITOKEN into the job classad.  All the infrastructure is in place to do so (from the prior X509 work) but is currently not implemented.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:05", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Aug-31 17:09", "fixed_version": "2020-Aug-31 17:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "fermi", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelman@morgridge.org tannenba@cs.wisc.edu zmiller@cs.wisc.edu maltunay@fnal.gov fkhan@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
