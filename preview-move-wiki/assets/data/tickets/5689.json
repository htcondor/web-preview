{"id": 5689, "title": "Ticket #5689: HTCondor not running reconfig as root", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen parsing configuration the master daemon only runs as root during startup.  After the daemon has started up, it will run as the condor user during reconfigs.  Due to this behavior we must have a sudo entry for condor so that it can pull from git repository and replace root-owned files during reconfiguration.  When I spoke to TJ Knoeller during HTCondor week, he suggested that this was probably not expected behavior and asked me to make a ticket.  This is that ticket.\n\n<p>-Aaron Moate</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2016-May-24 16:56", "status": "new", "created": "2016-May-24 16:32", "fixed_version": "2016-May-24 16:32", "broken_version": "v080505", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonMaster", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "moate", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wiscmoate@gmail.com, egrasmick", "due_date": ""}
