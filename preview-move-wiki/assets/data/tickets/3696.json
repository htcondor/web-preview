Is it just for the Python API bindings?  If so, seems like HTCondor would run just fine without Python, and any folks who want to use the Python API bindings likely already have Python :).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-12 11:08:26 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Todd,\n\n<p>Yes, you need the dependency on python.\n\n</p><p>It's possible that the user is installing the SL5 package on SL6.
