{"id": 5167, "title": "Ticket #5167: Master getting stuck shutting down personal condor", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe probably see a couple insatnces of the master getting stuck on shutdown per couple days. A while back we made it an error for a personal condor set up by a test not going down at the end of a test. In the case I was looking at last night, everything\nbut the startd stayed running. The master log said it got sigterm and was starting\na graceful shutdown. It said it sent signal 15 to startd and went dark.\n\n<p>complete run and logs ~bt/public/masterstuck\n\n</p><p>In point of fact the master sent the signal to the correct pid assuming we believe that when it says it does, we know it was actually sent. Since the response never came back, it waits forever. I would think resending the signal after a modest wait might be a better way then waiting forever and leaving the other daemons up.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Nov-11 08:17", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2015-Jul-21 09:43", "fixed_version": "2015-Jul-21 09:43", "broken_version": "v080307", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "#4520", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
