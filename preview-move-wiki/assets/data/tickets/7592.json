{"id": 7592, "title": "Ticket #7592: Add an include dir feature to condor mapfiles", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor HTCondor-CE, we'd like the ability to add lines to our condor_mapfiles to include directories containing additional mapfiles. We were imagining a syntax like the following:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>SCITOKENS https://demo.scitokens.org bbockelm@users.opensciencegrid.org\nSCITOKENS https://iam-escape.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/ bbockelm@users.opensciencegrid.org\nSCITOKENS https://scitokens.org/dteam dteam@users.opensciencegrid.org\n@include /path/to/mapfiles.d/\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Where lines in the mapfile would be parsed in order, then when an include dir line is encountered, HTCondor would parse files in the directory in lexicographical order.\n\n</p><p>We'd also like the ability to have multiple include directories in a single mapfile for default mappings and admin overrides (and therefore should be able to handle empty directories).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 10:38:23 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThat all seems reasonable.  Seems like admin overrides would just be an include at the top of the file, since first match wins.  And defaults could just go last.
