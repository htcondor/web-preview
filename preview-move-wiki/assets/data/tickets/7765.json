{"id": 7765, "title": "Ticket #7765: Remove C bindings for internal APIs", "description": "<blockquote>\nA lot of our functions have C linkage and some of our header files hide C++ symbols when included in C source files. This is due to our lineage of C source code, the last of which disappeared with the standard universe. Most of this is now clutter that can be removed. But we need to be careful to leave in C-linkage that's visible to external code (unless we want to discourage external usage).</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Jul-29 12:27", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Jul-29 12:27", "fixed_version": "2020-Jul-29 12:27", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
