{"id": 3754, "title": "Ticket #3754: implement periodic checkpoints for DMTCP vanilla checkpointing", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis is a hard requirement for LIGO to abandon standard universe, but is lower priority than <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3320\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3320'); return false;\" title=\"allow DMTCP checkpoints to be stored+retrieved on checkpoint server\">#3320</a></span> (allow DMTCP checkpoints to be stored+retrieved on checkpoint server) since the common case on LIGO is orderly job checkpointing within the max vacate time (due to preemption or shutdown), not unexpected node failures or exceeding the max vacate time.  (Although that may chance if we use more opportunistic resources, e.g., the Syracuse campus pool.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Nov-22 14:09:25 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nClosing this for now; KVM checkpointing looks much more promising.
