The example\nfor executable piped include is a script which does an \"ls\" of a file glob\nto generate a list of input file transfers. Since that can now be done\nwith the queue matching syntax, it would be a good idea to update this\nexample to do something that's both useful and in alignment with submit\ndescription best practices.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2016-Sep-22 12:09", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Sep-22 12:09", "fixed_version": "2016-Sep-22 12:09", "broken_version": "v080506", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "s8731", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
