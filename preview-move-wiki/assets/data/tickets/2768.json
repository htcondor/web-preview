{"id": 2768, "title": "Ticket #2768: Monitor startd swapping rates", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe have several handles on the node swap rate (either for the whole node, or per-job).  We should report these statistics, both in the startd ad and the job ads.\n\n<p>It's likely the swap rate is a more interesting number than the absolute amount of swap used, as high swap usage but very low swap rate affects the resource utilization differently from low swap usage but high swap rate.\n\n</p><p>Note - the per-job swap rate is based on the availability of this information in the memory cgroup.  While this is available on RHEL6 by default, Fedora 16 has turned it off by default (it's now an optional boot parameter), complaining about the overhead of instrumenting swap.  We should try to understand the direction the community is going on this topic.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2012-Jan-16 23:03", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jan-16 23:03", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-16 23:03", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "bbockelm", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
