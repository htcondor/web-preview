It's good that this was effective, but bad that nobody had any idea it was going on.\n\n<p>We should have the master warn us (log a message the test suite recognizes as an error) when it has to kill a child process that it itself didn't start (that is, one of its grandchildren).  I'm not sure if actually have any tests where multiple scheduler universe jobs are deliberately still running when we shut the schedd down, but putting a warning in would still be a good idea.  It might also be a good idea to run such a test if we don't already.\n\n</p><p>Doing this for the master is more important, but it probably also applies to the startd killing stray processes from the starter.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2018-Jan-24 14:10", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Jan-19 14:45", "fixed_version": "2018-Jan-19 14:45", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonMaster", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#6539", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
