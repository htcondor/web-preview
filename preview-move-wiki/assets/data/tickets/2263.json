{"id": 2263, "title": "Ticket #2263: ssh_to_job does not work with glexec jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nssh_to_job fails for jobs that are run via glexec.  The reason is that the login name requested by the ssh client is wrong.  It matches the login name of the condor user, not the login name of the user running the job.  Other than that, everything appears to be working: sshd is run via glexec in the job's sandbox, which is owned by the target user.  Since sshd does not run with root privs, it will reject any request for a uid other than the one it is running under.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jun-23 14:37:09 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI pushed a patch for release in 7.6.2 that solves this problem.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Jun-23 14:33</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=22280\">[22280]</a></span>: ssh_to_job now works with glexec. ===GT:Fixed=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2263\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2263'); return false;\" title=\"ssh_to_job does not work with glexec jobs\">#2263</a></span> ===VersionHistory=== condor_ssh_to_job now works with jobs that are run via glexec.
