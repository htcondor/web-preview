{"id": 2732, "title": "Ticket #2732: Create a new condor_reset_stats tool", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor testing, it would be convenient to have a tool that clears out \"Recent\" windowed statistics.  This enables tests to have a common state to test against.\n\n<p>This tool will be built as part of <code>condor_reconfig</code>, and <code>ln</code> 'ed to <code>condor_reset_stats</code>.  The scope of this is for testing.\n\n</p><p>Looking forward, the tool will need to know (machine,port,pool name) triple.\n\n</p><p>Statistics already have Tick, Publish, and Reset methods.  Need to learn how to use these correctly.\n\n</p><p>There is a question about what to do to statistics that are not part of pools.\nBy definition, a statistics pool is a set of statistics that share ticks and window size.\n\n</p><p>Also, should there be an option to specify lifetime statistics or windowed statistics?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/517/0001-Create-the-condor_reset_stats-tool.patch\">0001-Create-the-condor_reset_stats-tool.patch</a>\n33225 bytes added by nwp on 2012-Jan-06 17:07:23 UTC.\n<br/>\nFirst patch for reset_stats<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jun-10 13:42", "status": "pending", "created": "2011-Dec-28 11:46", "fixed_version": "2011-Dec-28 11:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#2197", "creator": "nwp", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
