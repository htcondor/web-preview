{"id": 4050, "title": "Ticket #4050: detect and attempt to avoid problems caused by DNS lookup delays", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere have been several instances where doing a DNS lookup blocks for several seconds, causing trouble for a busy HTCondor machine such as cascading timeouts. See ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3097\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3097'); return false;\" title=\"fix vulnerability to DNS-lookup delays\">#3097</a></span> for one such example.\n\n<p>Also, resolving the DNS names in ALLOW_ lists is done \"lazily\" which means it often happens while in the process of sending or receiving a command.  If an entry is in mutliple ALLOW_ lists, it is looked up several times, which is inefficient.  Also, the logging of failures is only done to D_FULLDEBUG, making the problem difficult to diagnose.  This ticket exists to improve the situation.\n\n</p><p>Design doc here:\n  <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xsvc_KZsF71WEy5p-dJVKI12Bj3_NtCAnYsdJ8F3r7g/edit\">4050 Design Doc: Improve DNS resolution in ALLOW_* and DENY_* lists</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Nov-12 14:58", "status": "active", "created": "2013-Nov-06 10:26", "fixed_version": "2013-Nov-06 10:26", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
