{"id": 2107, "title": "Ticket #2107: optimize globus gridmap calls", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen GSI authentication happens, the globus gridmap code is called to map the authenticated user to a local name.  This is done even if condor is configured to completely ignore the globus mapping.  Doing the globus mapping is inefficient if the result is never used, especially if the mapping calls out to some fairly expensive service.\n\n<p>To improve the situation, we should call the globus mapping only when we actually want the result.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Jul-28 13:07:03 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nThis was fixed during other improvements to the Globus callouts.
