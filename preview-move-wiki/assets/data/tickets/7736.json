{"id": 7736, "title": "Ticket #7736: Remove 1-second sleep in file xfer when upload_changed_files is true", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn our <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=FileTransfer\" title=\"File Transfer\">FileTransfer</a></span> object, the <code>DownloadFiles()</code> method sleeps for 1 second whenever <code>upload_changed_files</code> is True. This was done because older POSIX APIs only provided 1 second resolution for changed time of files. The modern APIs have nanosecond resolution, so we should remove this sleep and update our time checks to use newer methods.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Dec-04 11:24:08 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm abandoning this ticket; it's a good idea in theory, but the practicalities of supporting different time resolutions in various Windows and POSIX file systems make it impractical to implement.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2020-Dec-04 11:24", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2020-Jul-15 13:57", "fixed_version": "2020-Jul-15 13:57", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "FileTransfer", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "", "creator": "coatsworth", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
