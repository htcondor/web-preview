It's also hard on the batch systems - which are often optimized for bulk queries.\n\n</p><p>We should add a new status command that retrieves all jobs for the given user.  Any of the resulting jobs known to the gridmanager ought to have their status updated.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-May-10 20:48", "status": "new", "created": "2015-May-10 20:46", "fixed_version": "2015-May-10 20:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#5045", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
