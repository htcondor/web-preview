In particular, I noticed that a number of jobs in the LIGO CIT SL7.2 pool that where relying on this default where being rejected by partitionable slot STARTD\u2019s with,\n</p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>07/09/16 15:07:44 slot1_3: New machine resource of type -1 allocated\n07/09/16 15:07:44 Setting up slot pairings\n07/09/16 15:07:44 slot1_3: Slot requirements not satisfied.\n07/09/16 15:07:44 slot1_3: Job ad was ============================\n</pre></div>\n\nHowever, if I condor_qedit <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RequestMemory\" title=\"Request Memory\">RequestMemory</a></span> to be quantize(ImageSize/1024,1) then jobs are not rejected and start in a dynamic slot.\n\n<p>I believe there are a few problems:\n\n</p><p>0) Sec 3.5.1.19 states a different default default value,\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.4/3_5Policy_Configuration.html#37135\">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.4/3_5Policy_Configuration.html#37135</a>\n</p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>JOB_DEFAULT_REQUESTMEMORY = ifThenElse(MemoryUsage =!= UNDEFINED, MemoryUsage, 1)\n</pre></div>\n\nthen what I observe and what is stated in Sec 3.3.13,\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.4/3_3Configuration.html#25623\">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.4/3_3Configuration.html#25623</a>\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>ifThenElse(MemoryUsage =!= UNDEFINED,MemoryUsage,(ImageSize+1023)/1024)\n</pre></div>\n\n1) It looks like <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RequestMemory\" title=\"Request Memory\">RequestMemory</a></span> must be an integer to be effective. I first tried manually calculating a reasonable <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RequestMemory\" title=\"Request Memory\">RequestMemory</a></span> value for a test job and entered that via condor_qedit as a real number. However, even when I seriously inflated the value STARTD for the partitionable slot would still reject the job until I rounded that to an integer.\n\n<p>2) Even with STARTD_DEBUG = D_ALL I was unable to find a mention in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StartLog\" title=\"Start Log\">StartLog</a></span> of what \u201cSlot requirements\u201d where not satisfied. I think it would be very helpful to log this and make it easy to access, e.g., from a submit machine I would love to see \u201ccondor_q -better-analyze JobId\u201d report details on the last failed attempt to start a job (if there was a match that was rejected).\n\n</p><p>3) Attempting to use the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ResidentSetSize\" title=\"Resident Set Size\">ResidentSetSize</a></span> directly (or via <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=MemoryUsage\" title=\"Memory Usage\">MemoryUsage</a></span>) in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RequestMemory\" title=\"Request Memory\">RequestMemory</a></span> did not work (even after rounding to an integer).
