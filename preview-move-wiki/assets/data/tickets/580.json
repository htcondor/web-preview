Upon issuing a condor_reconfig, however, everything worked.\n\n<p>Perhaps a reconfig handler in the schedd gridmanager code is only called upon reconfig, and <em>not</em> called upon startup ???</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jun-18 16:57:29 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nYep, guess above was correct.
