{"id": 6552, "title": "Ticket #6552: CPUsUsage and GPUsUsage too long in user log usage report", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt's not generally important that the 'Assigned' column not to wrap (example below is at 80 columns), but when it's the fault of bogus precision in the floating-point usage column, it looks really silly.  We should limit the usage column to two digits past the decimal point.  (This will be annoying because the output code doesn't currently use a numeric representation for the usage column.)\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>...\n005 (205.002.000) 02/02 11:21:33 Job terminated.\n        (1) Normal termination (return value 0)\n                Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage\n                Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage\n                Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage\n                Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Local Usage\n        0  -  Run Bytes Sent By Job\n        0  -  Run Bytes Received By Job\n        0  -  Total Bytes Sent By Job\n        0  -  Total Bytes Received By Job\n        Partitionable Resources :              Usage  Request Allocated Assigned\n           Cpus                 :                0.0        1         1\n           Disk (KB)            :                 35     1024      3223\n           Memory (MB)          :                  1     1024      1024\n           Squids               : 0.5166666666666667        2         2 \"SQUID0,\nSQUID1\"\n...\n005 (205.003.000) 02/02 11:21:33 Job terminated.\n        (1) Normal termination (return value 0)\n                Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage\n                Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage\n                Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage\n                Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Local Usage\n        0  -  Run Bytes Sent By Job\n        0  -  Run Bytes Received By Job\n        0  -  Total Bytes Sent By Job\n        0  -  Total Bytes Received By Job\n        Partitionable Resources :                 Usage  Request Allocated Assigned\n           Cpus                 : 0.0006820117511180956        1         1\n           Disk (KB)            :                    35     1024      3223\n           Memory (MB)          :                     3     1024      1024\n           Squids               :                              2         2 \"SQUID2,\nSQUID3\"\n...\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>(Ignore the missing SQUIDs usage -- that's another ticket.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-Feb-02 11:36", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Feb-02 11:36", "fixed_version": "2018-Feb-02 11:36", "broken_version": "v080707", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
