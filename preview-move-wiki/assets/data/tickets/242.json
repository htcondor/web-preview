{"id": 242, "title": "Ticket #242: Clean up /unsup/condor/etc/hosts", "description": "<blockquote>\n/unsup/condor/etc/hosts is a mess, with over 2,000 files, of which at least 500 are completely unused.  This needs to be cleaned out.  Furthermore, a bunch of files either aren't in CVS, or are uncommitted.\n\n<p>/unsup/condor/etc/hosts/local_config_report writes a report to standard output about the state of these files.  It can detect many problems (and hopefully will be extended to catch more.)\n\n</p><p>Remember that any changes should be committed to CVS!</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Mar-20 17:17:45 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nI purged about 750 files.  This should occasionally be revisited, but it's good enough for now.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-21 11:00", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Feb-23 14:42", "fixed_version": "2009-Feb-23 14:42", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
