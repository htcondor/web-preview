The config file we distribute for linux sets CONSOLE_DEVICS to \"mouse, console\". On my CSL desktop, /dev/console is a valid device whose atime isn't updated (the reason we use the kbdd). If CONSOLE_DEVICES isn't set in the config file, the new config param table defaults it to \"mouse, console\".\n\n<p>The code in sysapi includes a comment from 1999 saying we should ignore the kbdd if we can stat any console devices, but doesn't say why. It doesn't ignore the kbdd for <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=KeyboardIdle\" title=\"Keyboard Idle\">KeyboardIdle</a></span>. I propose that sysapi be changed to never ignore the kbdd for console activity.\n\n</p><p>Also, the documentation for the kbdd needs to be updated. It says that the kbdd is only useful on Digital Unix.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Feb-26 15:19:49 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed fix to V7_4-branch.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Feb-26 15:13</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f0c4ef21a93c7e635df2976f084c165c920da413\">[17353]</a></span>: Don't ignore kbdd when checking console devices. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1251\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1251'); return false;\" title=\"Kbdd ignored by default on linux\">#1251</a></span> When checking for console activity, if param CONSOLE_DEVICES includes any valid devices, sysapi will completely ignore any reports from the kbdd.
