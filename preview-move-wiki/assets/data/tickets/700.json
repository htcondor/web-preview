This is causing the lib_eventlog test to fail.\n\n<p>The order of things appears to be thus:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>condor_submit submits job to schedd\n</li><li>schedd writes partial submit event to event log\n</li><li>condor_submit writes correct submit event to event log\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>I've captured the whole exchange via strace.\n\n</p><p>I'm not entirely certain why we haven't been observing this behavior forever.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Aug-27 21:31:10 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nAhh, found the problem.
