{"id": 2761, "title": "Ticket #2761: default user priority factor is too small", "description": "<blockquote>\nOut-of-the-box, condor gives local users priority factor 1.  This is the smallest possible factor, so it is not possible to improve anybody's factor.  Instead, you have to make everybody else's factor worse.\n\n<p>This has bit us in several occasions, most recently in the CHTC glidein pool.\n\n</p><p>The workaround is to configure the default priority factor to be something &gt; 1, such as 1000.  But why won't condor_userprio allow setting the user priority to something less than 1?  I'm not aware of a reason why it must be &gt; 1.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Jan-13 11:28", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jan-13 11:28", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-13 11:28", "broken_version": "v070705", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu,tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
