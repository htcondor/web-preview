(We put a checkpoint server on each execute node.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-May-28 15:56:47 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nFWIW, on the LIGO Data Grid we currently have a checkpoint server per startd -- so although long-term we need the ability to change this and a central checkpoint server, initially an implementation that only supported our current config might be okay.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-22 14:08:06 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nClosing this for now; KVM checkpointing looks much more promising. Will reopen only if KVM checkpointing doesn't work out for some reason.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Nov-22 14:08", "status": "defer", "created": "2012-Nov-13 15:10", "fixed_version": "2012-Nov-13 15:10", "broken_version": "v070901", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Std", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "", "creator": "pfc", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pfcouvar@syr.edu, anderson@ligo.caltech.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
