{"id": 4504, "title": "Ticket #4504: Concurrency test extension - sequential job submition", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe suspect a bug with static concurrency limits. The idea was to submit slower towards a configured limit. However SimpleJob::RunCheck does not return until\nall the queue request complete and with sleep forever jobs, how do you submit additional jobs slowly, and with the same submit file and callbacks?\n\n<p>The solution was to provide a callback so <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RunCheck\" title=\"Run Check\">RunCheck</a></span> can give you the name of\nthe submit file it is creating. Then for each extra job you fork a child to\ncall <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RunTest\" title=\"Run Test\">RunTest</a></span> passing the testname and the submit file which gets you the same callbacks.\n\n</p><p>Note this means you can not do things in callbacks with counters! In these tests we examine run queue for running and idle tests. The is a main callback in the parent which repeats evry 10 seconds as things change.\n\n</p><p>We configure a hash and a taskname for each part of the tests adding as the value the number of additional jobs desired and the parents callback kicks\nthem off, one per callback.\n\n</p><p><strong class=\"three\">ToDo</strong>\nAll six tests are currently in slow submit mode due to a suspected bug\nwith static slots and currency greater then one when jobs are submitted\nqueue N. Once resolved, we'l do queue N submits and sequental(current mode)\n\n</p><p>At this point job_concurrency_limitsS.run displays the issue fairly quickly in queue mode. Set $burst == 1 near top to flip to queue N submits.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Aug-04 11:02</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=40827\">[40827]</a></span>: Allow callback for submit file name being created <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"active\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4504\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4504'); return false;\" title=\"Concurrency test extension - sequential job submition\">#4504</a></span> but also submit jobs sequentialy not in a batch.
