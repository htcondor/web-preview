When the negotiator asks the Schedd for jobs, it won't mention the higher priority jobs.  As the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ScheddLog\" title=\"Schedd Log\">ScheddLog</a></span> notes:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">4/23 16:31:24 (pid:8195) Negotiating for owner: condor@cs.wisc.edu\n4/23 16:31:24 (pid:8195) Reached MAX_JOBS_RUNNING: no more can run, 0 jobs match\ned, 250 jobs idle\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Expected behavior: these jobs should be offered to the negotiator for matching.  Of course, there are complications.
