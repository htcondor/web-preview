{"id": 3608, "title": "Ticket #3608: Have HTCondor do CPU-level performance accounting", "description": "<blockquote>\nModern CPUs all can provide detailed accounting about what your jobs did with the CPU time they were given.  A simple example is that the CPU can tell you how many instructions were run, or the cache hit ratio.\n\n<p>At least in CMS, we care deeply about these metrics (and their trending over time) but have only ad-hoc measurements by the devs.  We'd like to see HTCondor automatically report these for us.\n\n</p><p>Linux provides a syscall to read these counters from user processes without any additional privileges.  Alternately, a root user can monitor all processes in a cgroup.\n\n</p><p>Branch posted:\n\n</p><p><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/bbockelm/htcondor/tree/V7_9-perf-branch\">https://github.com/bbockelm/htcondor/tree/V7_9-perf-branch</a>\n\n</p><p>Design doc pending, but the basics are outlined here:\n\n</p><p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2013/presentations/BockelmanB_Containers.pdf\">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2013/presentations/BockelmanB_Containers.pdf</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nHit submit twice - dup of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3607\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3607'); return false;\" title=\"Have HTCondor do CPU-level performance monitoring\">#3607</a></span>.
