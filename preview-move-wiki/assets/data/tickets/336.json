{"id": 336, "title": "Ticket #336: GCB: /tmp/gcb-inherit-XXXXXX problems: not unlinked, root owned", "description": "<blockquote>\nReported bug from psilord: User jobs under a GCBized starter end up leaving /tmp/gcb-inherit-XXXXXX files around.  They have permissions of 0000 (should have been fixed back in 7.0), and are owned by root (surprising).  The file should be 0600, and owned by the user the job will run as.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Mar-20 17:10:27 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nUnable to reproduce.  Tried repeatedly on my desktop (puffin), as well as the macaroni01-10 machines, on which psilord reported the problem.   In 100 tests on the macaroni machines, in every case the /tmp/gcb-inherit-XXXXXX file was 1. unlinked, 2. owned by adesmet, and 3. had permissions of 0600.  This is all as expected.  psilord only saw this once.  There are old gcb-inherit files on the macaroni machines that may have lead to an erroneous interpretation of what was happening.  So absent details on how to reproduce, I'm closing this.  Feel free to re-open with details.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 14:03", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Mar-20 13:34", "fixed_version": "2009-Mar-20 13:34", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "GCB", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
