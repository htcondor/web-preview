{"id": 2169, "title": "Ticket #2169: Clearly document that node priorities do not apply across sub-DAGs", "description": "<blockquote>\nMake it clear that sub-DAGs are completely separate as far as node priorities are concerned, and that the priorities don't propagate down to the sub-DAGs.  Probably should give an example like Logan's situation, where he thought that a better priority for one sub-DAG would mean that all of its jobs would get priority over jobs from another sub-DAG that had lower priority in the upper-level DAG.  (From today's meeting with Spalding lab people.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jul-12 12:46:23 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nReasonably simple, partial DAG input file example to help illustrate:\n\n<p></p><pre>    SUBDAG EXTERNAL A  A.dag\n    SUBDAG EXTERNAL B  B.dag\n    PRIORITY A  100\n    PRIORITY B  0\n</pre>\n\n<p>Once any node jobs of A and B are submitted, then this priority setting is completely irrelevant.  Yes, the first 5 (default) jobs of A are going to be submitted first, but other than that, setting the <code>PRIORITY</code>  of subdag A and/or subdag B has no effect.  This priority is not transmitted in any way to the separate subdags.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Feb-13 14:40:26 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nI think this changed in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2167\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2167'); return false;\" title=\"Propagate DAG node priorities down to job priorities\">#2167</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Jul-13 10:13</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=26063\">[26063]</a></span>: node PRIORITY of SUBDAGs is not propagated to submission of the SUBDAGs ===GT:Fixed=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2169\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2169'); return false;\" title=\"Clearly document that node priorities do not apply across sub-DAGs\">#2169</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2012-Feb-13 14:40", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-May-17 17:32", "fixed_version": "2011-May-17 17:32", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, smoler@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
