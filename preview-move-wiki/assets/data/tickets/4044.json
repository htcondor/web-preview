The jobs that are targeted first for eviction are those whose <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ImageSize\" title=\"Image Size\">ImageSize</a></span> are the most out of bounds with regards to their <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RequestedMemory\" title=\"Requested Memory\">RequestedMemory</a></span>. A current <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ImageSize\" title=\"Image Size\">ImageSize</a></span> of the job as opposed to the high-water mark from a previous attempt would provide better control.\n\n</p><p>RFE is for a new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ImageSize\" title=\"Image Size\">ImageSize</a></span> attribute that reports the current/active <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ImageSize\" title=\"Image Size\">ImageSize</a></span> of a job.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nConsensus with customer that this RFE is obsoleted by cgroups functionality.
