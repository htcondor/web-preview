When the old procd finally exits, the pipes being used by the new procd get deleted.  Now when the starter tries to use the procd, it fails.  For example, a local universe job fails in the following way:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>ERROR \"ProcD has failed\" at line 608 in file /home/condor/execute/dir_19479/userdir/src/condor_utils/proc_family_proxy.cpp\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The problem is not self-correcting.  The starter will fail in this way until the schedd is restarted.  Similar types of errors happen on the execute side.\n\n</p><p>To remedy the situation, the administrator must stop Condor and ensure that all processes (especially the procd) are gone before restarting Condor.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2014-Jul-28 12:59", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Mar-21 11:40", "fixed_version": "2011-Mar-21 11:40", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu,sfiligoi@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
