{"id": 1788, "title": "Ticket #1788: Opening /dev/null for write with O_CREATE fails on solaris 11", "description": "<blockquote>\nOn x86-64 Solaris 11, attempts to open /dev/null for writing with O_CREAT via safe_open_wrapper() fails with errno 6 (ENXIO). This is because safe_open_wrapper() first tries to open the file with O_EXCL and bombs out if that fails with an error other than EEXIST. On Solaris 11, the open returns ENXIO instead.\n\n<p>On Solaris, /dev/null is a sym-link to /devices/pseudo/mm@0:null, a character special file. Attempts to open the character special file with O_EXCL work as expected (fail with EEXIST). Attempts to open a file that sym-links to the character special file with O_EXCL work as expected (fail with EEXIST). But on Solaris 11, opening /dev/null with O_EXCL fails with ENXIO. This goes against the man-page for open(), which says opening a sym-link with O_EXCL always fails with EEXIST.\n\n</p><p>This came up in the test suite, where the Condor-C test jobs have their stdout and stderr set to /dev/null.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:50:47 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:20:02 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Dec-01 14:14</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=19503\">[19503]</a></span>: Fix procd problems <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1785\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1785'); return false;\" title=\"privsep switchboard fails on broken symlinks\">#1785</a></span> and solaris 11 /dev/null problem <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1788\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1788'); return false;\" title=\"Opening /dev/null for write with O_CREATE fails on solaris 11\">#1788</a></span> starter would error is user created symbolic link to nowhere in the sandbox.
