The gridmanager should use that address for further attempts to connect to the jobmanager.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Apr-03 16:22:29 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe infinite loop doesn't consume much cpu and the gridmanager continues to manage other jobs normally.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Apr-03 16:28</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/0e2d2501e23a48939bf2e849b521b72e2aa480b4\">[31094]</a></span>: Fixed an infinite loop in the gridmanager for gt2 jobs. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2916\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2916'); return false;\" title=\"Infinite loop in gridmanager for gram jobs\">#2916</a></span> If the jobmanager is listening on a different port than what's in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GridJobId\" title=\"Grid Job Id\">GridJobId</a></span>, the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GlobusJob\" title=\"Globus Job\">GlobusJob</a></span> object will bounce between states GM_REGISTER and GM_RESTART, always attempting to contact the jobmanager using the incorrect port.
