when released this job matched the same slot on the same machine and generated a repeat of the same error 3 days later.\n\n<p>Here is a quick scan through this particular cluster that only shows these errors on a restricted range of cluster nodes. In particular, node501 and above are all faster (10G connected Sandy Bridge) cluster nodes, so perhaps it is a race condition. There is also a bias towards using partitionable slots on the higher number nodes so it might be related to that (or perhaps the combination take together). You can also see the mix of executables involved, including /bin/taskset and condor_ssh_to_job_sshd_setup as well as user application code (gstlal_inspiral).\n\n</p><p>Any help in tracking this down

error 666666 when attempting to execute jobs.  In our case, many of the errors happened on machines that are not using partitionable slots.  We also seem to see a bias towards higher error rates on newer beefier machines.

When a new job tries to occupy the vacated slot, the system\nwon't allow it because the user, i.e. \"gstlalcbc\", has reached or\nexceeded the limitby then.\n\n</p><p>The work-around is to set a really high limit in\n/etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf (RHEL6) and\n/etc/security/limits.d/20-nproc.conf(RHEL7).
