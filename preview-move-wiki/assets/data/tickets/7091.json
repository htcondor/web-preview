{"id": 7091, "title": "Ticket #7091: Shadow EXCEPTs too readily", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe shadow calls EXCEPT() or ASSERT() in a lot of common error conditions that aren't programmer errors and frequently are not fatal. When <code>ABORT_ON_EXCEPTION</code> is set to True, this can lead to a lot of unnecessary core files. The shadow should be made more resilient to common failures. When such failures are non-recoverable, the shadow should have a less drastic way to notify the schedd.\n\n<p>Here are some failures we've observed recently in CHTC:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Starter failed to contact the transfer queue manager (i.e. schedd).\n</li><li>Starter began output transfer while input transfer was active (main cause fixed in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6728\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6728'); return false;\" title=\"Undefined job policy expression can put job in tight run/idle cycle\">#6728</a></span>)\n</li><li>RPC connection closed when sending a reply. Starter timed out because shadow was blocked connecting to schedd.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Jun-06 11:46", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Jun-04 11:08", "fixed_version": "2019-Jun-04 11:08", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
