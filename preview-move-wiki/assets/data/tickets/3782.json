One case I looked at had over 2 minutes of negotiation\ncycle but failed to find the end negotiation cycle. We have a try for a bit based on a timeout and then try some more. Kludgy and troublesome and predates having an actual timeout set up by the test. Attempting to shrink the log size, as we don't need fulldebug and loosening up this loose timeout mechanism a bit more.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jul-16 13:05", "status": "active", "created": "2013-Jul-15 16:28", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-15 16:28", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "bt", "derived_from": "#3741", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
