We can decide if the defrag daemon should ignore machines with the latter's attribute set by default later.\n\n</p><p>The <strong>-off</strong> flag <em>must</em> fail if issues to a startd which doesn't support it.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Apr-14 11:11", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Apr-14 11:11", "fixed_version": "2020-Apr-14 11:11", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, sba@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
