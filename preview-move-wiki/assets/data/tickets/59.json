{"id": 59, "title": "Ticket #59: There exists a set of Windows executables that Condor cannot identify.", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere exists a set of Windows executables that Condor cannot identify correctly.  A user submitted and executable on the condor-users list that can be executed from a Windows console, but will not pass Condor's executable tests.\n\n<p>It is possible for a test program to determine that it is a Win32 executable via a call to GetBinaryType(); however, it too fails on MapAndLoad().  Both of these calls are used in Condor, but the call to GetBinaryType() fails in Condor, which is a bit of an oddity to me.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jan-22 10:26:13 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nWhile we are at it, when Condor DOES conclude that the executable is not a legit binary, that error should propagate back to the user instead of just sitting in the starter log.  So Create_Process should set return_errno appropriately, and the starter should check errno is Create_Process fails and EXCEPT with a more specific/helpful error message (which Condor then propagates back to the shadow &amp; user log).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-21 15:31:12 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nBen Burnett has left the Condor Project.
