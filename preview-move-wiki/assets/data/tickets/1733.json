{"id": 1733, "title": "Ticket #1733: run_nightly_builds needs to distinguish logs.", "description": "<blockquote>\n<code>run_nightly_builds</code> is run multiple times in the crontab on nmi-s006 for various buildsets. However, it only writes one log and ultimately overwrites previous incarnations for each build. We want to keep the behavior where it overwrites a log file, but we want to change the log file it uses. Adding a command line argument to enable this feature would solve it.\n\n<p>I'm adding one.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Oct-25 14:15:29 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI fixed the <code>run_nightly_build</code> script to accept a logfile argument. I fixed the crontab for the nightlies which runs that script to use it. And then I fixed the wiki page which describes it so people know how it works.\n\n<p>I also cleaned out some old build system crap from the crontab that we haven't used in many, many months.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-25 14:15:58 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThis ticket is resolved.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Oct-25 13:57</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=19207\">[19207]</a></span>: Did a little more hacking on the logfile argument parsing to have it act more like how someone expects. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1733\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1733'); return false;\" title=\"run_nightly_builds needs to distinguish logs.\">#1733</a></span>  (By Peter Keller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Oct-25 13:43</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=19206\">[19206]</a></span>: Turns out that when we call this script multiple times in the crontab in order to build different build and test sets, they overwrite each other's logfile and that is annoying for debugging.
