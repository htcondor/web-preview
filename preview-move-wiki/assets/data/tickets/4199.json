We don't want to delete users who are not longer active as it mucks up the history (especially if we delete \"bob\", and a year later a different person claims the \"bob\" account).  To keep the list trim, we'll limit it to users with the \"Check-In\" capability, which we overload to mean \"has signed the contributor's agreement.\"  In general, those should be the only people owning tickets anyway.\n\n<p>Places to change (hopefully they all share a single SQL statement):\n</p><ul>\n<li>Create A New Ticket - <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktnew\">https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktnew</a>\n</li><li>Edit Ticket - <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktedit?tn=1\">https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktedit?tn=1</a></li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Feb-05 14:01", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Feb-05 14:01", "fixed_version": "2014-Feb-05 14:01", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
