{"id": 4721, "title": "Ticket #4721: DAGman submit to same queue", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt would be nice if a running DAGman job could submit to the same queue that it is running under. Consider a server running two queues. The current behavior is that a scheduler universe job running on q2 will submit its jobs to q1. The ideal behavior is that it would submit to q2 unless explicitly told to do otherwise.\n\n<p>Sadly, patching this myself is beyond my skills, but I'd be happy to help however I can.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Nov-17 13:20:12 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- can you clarify a little bit?  Are you saying that the job will always be submitted to the queue that's the one that's <strong>not</strong> running DAGMan?  Or is there something about q1 that makes the jobs prefer it?  In other words, is this symmetric or not?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Nov-17 13:27:18 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOr are you basically saying that if you specify\n\n<p></p><pre>  condor_submit_dag -schedd-address-file &lt;file&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>the -schedd-address-file specification should apply to the DAG's node jobs but doesn't?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Nov-17 13:41:05 by bcotton:</em> <br/>\n\nDAGman currently always submits to Q1, regardless of which queue the condor_dagman job is running in. That's because we set SCHEDD_HOST in the config. Without SCHEDD_HOST set, DAGs submitted to Q2 won't successfully submit jobs at all.\n\n<p></p><div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nOr are you basically saying that if you specify\n\ncondor_submit_dag -schedd-address-file &lt;file&gt;\n\nthe -schedd-address-file specification should apply to the DAG's node jobs but doesn't?\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>Yes, ish. (-schedd-address-file doesn't seem to work in 8.2.3, as I recently noted on htcondor-users, and in this case we're not actually submitting with that argument, but via a submit file).\n\n</p><p>I can force the desired behavior by manually specifying _CONDOR_SCHEDD_HOST in the environment, but I'm not sure of a good way to automatically detect and set that (since the jobs are submitted dynamically by <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CycleServer\" title=\"Cycle Server\">CycleServer</a></span> and there's no way of knowing a priori where it will end up).\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Nov-17 13:55:05 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nWouldn't it be reasonable to have _condor_SCHEDD_HOST automatically set by the schedd for all scheduler / local universe jobs (if not already set in the job?)?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Nov-17 15:04:25 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nAh, okay, you're saying that the node jobs go to whatever queue SCHEDD_HOST in the config is pointing to, no matter which queue the DAGMan job itself is submitted to, right?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Nov-17 15:19:13 by bcotton:</em> <br/>\n\nThat's correct. I've tried a variety of ways of forcing the issue (including setting SCHEDD.Q2.SCHEDD_ENVIRONMENT = \"_CONDOR_SCHEDD_HOST=$(SCHEDD.Q2.SCHEDD_NAME)\", SCHEDD_ENVIRONMENT = \"_CONDOR_SCHEDD_HOST=$(SCHEDD_NAME)\", and even using _CONDOR_SCHEDD_HOST=$$([regexps(\"\"(.*)#(.*)#(.*)\"\",GlobalJobId,\"\"\\1\"\")]) in the job's environment setting), to no avail.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Nov-17 17:12:20 by bcotton:</em> <br/>\n\nFor what it's worth, specifying _CONDOR_SCHEDD_HOST=$$([regexps(\"\"(.*)#(.*)#(.*)\"\",GlobalJobId,\"\"\\1\"\")]) in the submit file's environment setting would work except that such expansions happen in the shadow, so don't help for scheduler universe jobs.
