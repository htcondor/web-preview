{"id": 393, "title": "Ticket #393: Allow use of \"DAG templates\"", "description": "<blockquote>\nMiron wants some kind of capability to use a \"DAG template\" for cases where we have to do many similar workflows with slightly different data.  The idea is that you would have a DAG file and associated submit files that would be used as a template for a large number of actual DAGs.  The template files would have a bunch of $(xyz) variables in them, which would then be substituted when creating the \"real\" DAG.  So the user would be able to do sort of a 'foreach ...' where for each value you create and run a DAG.  It's not clear whether this capability should be part of condor_dagman or condor_submit_dag themselves, or part of some external tool (maybe SOAR).\n\n<p>The goal of this is to try to get people away from having to write things like custom Perl scripts to deal with sets of DAGs.  (This came up during discussions of the SIPHT workflows with Jon Livny.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-17 15:11", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-17 15:11", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
