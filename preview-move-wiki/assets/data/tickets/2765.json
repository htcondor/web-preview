{"id": 2765, "title": "Ticket #2765: Condor_rm doesn't work right on DAG in recovery mode", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf you condor_rm a condor_dagman that's in recovery mode, the DAGMan job is removed from the queue, but the process isn't actually killed until it has finished with recovery.  I think that what happens is that DAGMan never goes back into daemoncore during the recovery process, and that's why it doesn't respond to the signal to quit.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Jan-13 14:52", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jan-13 14:52", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-13 14:52", "broken_version": "v070704", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
