{"id": 2998, "title": "Ticket #2998: User priority factors: scheduled changes/leases", "description": "<blockquote>\nBased on a discussion with khahn. It's not uncommon in the CHTC to want to temporarily boost someone's priority.  Ideally this would be automatically undone.  So people might have a default of 100, and you want to drop someone to 10 for the next two weeks.  Currently the administrator needs to remember to reset the value in two weeks, or set up custom scripting to do the job.\n\n<p>Proposed: user priorities factors should have scheduled change support and/or leases.  For example, you might say:\n\n</p><p># Improve adesmet's priority immediately\ncondor_userprio -set adesmet 10 now\n# And in two weeks revert to 100, assuming today is 2012-5-1\ncondor_userprio -set adesmet 100 2012-5-15</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-May-16 17:26", "status": "new", "created": "2012-May-16 17:25", "fixed_version": "2012-May-16 17:25", "broken_version": "v060000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
