{"id": 1588, "title": "Ticket #1588: condor_stats output needs sorting", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe output of <code>condor_stats</code> changes order--specifically the location of the <code>Total</code> line, if any) a lot due to being emitted in hash table order (ultimately because it was saved in hash table order in the view history file). This annoys various users of Condor--see the rust ticket.\n\n<p>So, the fix would be to impose an ordering upon the output which makes sense for\nthe output queried and also to print <code>Total</code> --if it exists, last. Printing out <code>Total</code> last would make this tool more inline with the rest of Condor's tools.\n\n</p><p>Now, given all of the above, the output of <code>condor_stats</code> royally sucks and much\ncould be done to improve it as a general thing....\n\n</p><p>In addition, the rust user states:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>Only to remind, as you are suggesting that \"if Total line is present it will\nbe emitted at the bottom of the output\",  Condor View must be also reviewed\nto put the Total line on top line of the web page generated by\nmake_machine_stats script because the default graph corresponds to the\nTotal informations as in this case is the best presentation option.\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-27 16:39:01 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070404 to v070405 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jun-04 11:52", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Aug-18 14:00", "fixed_version": "2010-Aug-18 14:00", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "s7943", "customer_group": "support", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
