We should add DetectedCPUs, which is always the number of CPUs detected by the schedd and cannot be overwritten.  This would be of use for administrators, and was requested by NMI.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Dec-17 17:07:21 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nThis exists in 7.4.0, DETECTED_CORES and DETECTED_MEMORY\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>$ CONDOR_CONFIG=ONLY_ENV condor_config_val -dump | grep ^DETECTED\nDETECTED_CORES = 2\nDETECTED_MEMORY = 2005\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Thank Dan.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Dec-17 17:40:36 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nThe current fix isn't quite what this ticket asked for: the attributes don't appear in the machine <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span>.
