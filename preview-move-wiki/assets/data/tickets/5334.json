The default socket when not running as root should not be 9618 (for the collector or the shared port daemon).\n\n<p>Look for other tickets about this.\nLook for code for this.\n\n</p><p>The default for non-root should probably be :0, but just changing this at daemon spawn time is going to cause problems, because any portless address (e.g., bare hostname or IP) in the config file(s) won't know to check the address file (unless we do that anyway?)...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Aug-16 14:43:58 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nWe've changed the recommended way to construct a personal Condor to 'use role : personal', which sets the port number to :0 (making everything work).
