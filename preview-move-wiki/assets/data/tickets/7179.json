This assumes inbound connectivity on the local collector, however, which may be a mistake.  It also assumes that the local user has the privilege to advertise startds to the local collector; this is probably true, but certainly doesn't need to be.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Aug-01 13:10", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Aug-01 13:10", "fixed_version": "2019-Aug-01 13:10", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Annex", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#7100", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
