{"id": 752, "title": "Ticket #752: User command to force DeferralTime job to run immediately", "description": "<blockquote>\n(Based on a report by Scot Kronenfeld for the VDT.)\n\n<p>I'd like the ability to force a job to run NOW, and then continue on the normal schedule.  I don't know how many people would use this, but in the context of RSV, this would be a very useful addition.  Maybe it's already possible, but if so, I don't know how.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Sep-22 11:51:43 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\n(Based on a report from Alain Roy)\n\n<p>It's easy to imagine solutions that are easy from Condor's perspective. For example, it's easy to run a cron job \"now\" but editing a submit file and re-submitting it, but from the context of a system administrator it would be really nice to say \"condor_cron_run_job_now &lt;job-id&gt;\" and watch it run again. In order to get people to accept Condor cron, we want to make it as simple as possible to use.\n</p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 14:52", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Sep-22 11:42", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-22 11:42", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
