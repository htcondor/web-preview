{"id": 515, "title": "Ticket #515: VM load not considered Condor Load", "description": "<blockquote>\nCondor monitors all processes that is starts on a system to segregate system load average from condor load average. This allows for using load average information in Startd policy expressions.\n\n<p>Condor does not currently monitor VMware, Xen or KVM load. This means a policy that takes into account load average, e.g. the default CS policies, will behave in undesirable ways when load is created by a Condor started VM.\n\n</p><p>libvirt provides a means to query for the load of a VM.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Mar-23 13:46:49 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\narguably this is a bug, hence the target switch.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Oct-03 08:44:40 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nThis was resolved many moons ago back in 3/23 for whatever reason gittrac is totally failing to parse:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">    Update to take vm:u load into account in loadavg calculations.\n    Currently for kvm &amp;&amp; xen jobs load is ignored because it does not\n    fall under condors perview.
