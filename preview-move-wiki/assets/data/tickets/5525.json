This is a function which creates a classad based on the current condor configuration, and issues &gt; 400 param calls (!).  For unauthenticated connections (i.e. with host based security), we call this for every command on a socket.\n\n<p>Caching the creation of this classad results in a measureable performance improvement.  With a quick check, condor_advertise'ing 10,000 ads went from 10.7 seconds to 9.6 seconds of real time, at 10% improvement.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Mar-03 15:29:34 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nAs far as documentation goes, does this need anything besides a version history entry?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Apr-08 13:46:13 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nAs this is internal only, I don't think it merits a version history entry.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2016-Feb-24 11:05</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=47643\">[47643]</a></span>: Cache security policy ads <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=5525\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5525'); return false;\" title=\"Improve performance of security policy ad creation\">#5525</a></span> Quick measurement shows 10% decrease in real time when condor_advertising many ads.
