{"id": 7529, "title": "Ticket #7529: User-provided token attributes", "description": "<blockquote>\nNow that we have a 'blacklist' capability that treats tokens as <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>, we should leverage the fact that tokens are internally key-value pairs and additional attributes can be useful for managing the tokens.\n\n<p>For example, suppose I want the glideinWMS frontend to be able to generate a startd token that enables a pilot to advertise to a collector.  For audit purposes, I might like to add various domain-specific information to the token itself such as the CE or the site I submitted the pilot to.\n\n</p><p>Right now, we basically force folks to put this metadata into the identity as that's the only user-controlled thing -- and auditing is not an identity!</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Feb-29 07:38", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Feb-29 07:38", "fixed_version": "2020-Feb-29 07:38", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
