{"id": 435, "title": "Ticket #435: DAGMan core dumps if node has POST script and all submit attempts fail", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf you have a node for which all of the job submit attempts fail, and that node has a POST script, DAGMan core dumps when trying to write the POST_SCRIPT_TERMINATED event to the log file.  The core dump happens when it's trying to figure out whether the log file is XML-format or not.  (I'll bet this bug was introduced by the changes to handle log rotation in the user log reading code.  I think that in in the past, we defaulted to non-XML in this case, but the log reading code itself is segfaulting.)\n\n<p>(Hmm -- see also Gnats PRs 658 and 799.)\n\n</p><p>Here's the stack trace:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.\n[New process 29315]\n#0  0x08180264 in ReadUserLogState::IsLogType (this=0x0, t=LOG_TYPE_XML)\n    at read_user_log_state.h:134\n134     read_user_log_state.h: No such file or directory.\n        in read_user_log_state.h\n(gdb) where\n#0  0x08180264 in ReadUserLogState::IsLogType (this=0x0, t=LOG_TYPE_XML)\n    at read_user_log_state.h:134\n#1  0x0817cb0b in ReadUserLog::getIsXMLLog (this=0xbfc040ec)\n    at read_user_log.cpp:1355\n#2  0x08112957 in Dag::PostScriptReaper (this=0x95ffc78,\n    nodeName=0x9600660 \"0\", status=0) at dag.cpp:1496\n#3  0x08121874 in ScriptQ::ScriptReaper (this=0x96009d8, pid=29324,\nstatus=0)\n    at scriptQ.cpp:133\n#4  0x08139ac4 in DaemonCore::CallReaper (this=0x95db4e0, reaper_id=2,\n    whatexited=0x840821f \"pid\", pid=29324, exit_status=0)\n    at daemon_core.cpp:8286\n#5  0x0813d520 in DaemonCore::HandleProcessExit (this=0x95db4e0,\npid=29324,\n    exit_status=0) at daemon_core.cpp:8386\n#6  0x0813d69e in DaemonCore::HandleDC_SERVICEWAITPIDS (this=0x95db4e0)\n    at daemon_core.cpp:7962\n#7  0x081444d8 in DaemonCore::Driver (this=0x95db4e0) at\ndaemon_core.cpp:2590\n#8  0x0814d8a6 in main (argc=13, argv=0xbfc04a10) at\ndaemon_core_main.cpp:2097\n(gdb)\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nIt looks like this has actually gotten fixed in 7.2.4 or so.
