{"id": 2727, "title": "Ticket #2727: test_init_from_string_* unit tests are useless", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn the unit tests, in file <code>OTEST_Old_Classads.cpp</code>, the test functions <code>test_init_from_string_*()</code> aren't testing anything and will always pass. They allocate an empty classad using new, call ClassAd::initFromString() with various arguments, then check whether the pointer returned by new is NULL. If the pointer isn't NULL, the test passes. If it had been NULL, the program would have crashed.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Dec-21 14:10", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Dec-21 14:10", "fixed_version": "2011-Dec-21 14:10", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
