{"id": 7746, "title": "Ticket #7746: job_max_vacate_time submit descriptor not honored in local universe", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe submit descriptor <code>job_max_vacate_time</code> is not honored for <code>local</code> universe jobs (whether they run under a starter or not). TJ says this is because it is enforced by the startd, and there is no startd in local universe.\n\n<p>The particular case where this came up: a user was running a local universe job and condor_rm'd it. The user process inside the job got stuck while exiting, and since there is effectively no max vacate time, the job was stuck in the X state forever. Force-removal would get the job out of the queue, but not clean up the underlying job, so that's not a good option. Manually killing the user process inside the job let the starter exit cleanly.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Jul-21 11:00", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Jul-21 11:00", "fixed_version": "2020-Jul-21 11:00", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "karpel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "karpel@wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
