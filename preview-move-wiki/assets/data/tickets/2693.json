{"id": 2693, "title": "Ticket #2693: Include subdag external nodes in parent DAG's node status file", "description": "<blockquote>\nBill just asked me for this -- he wants to use the node status files in his SOAR workflows, and he'd like to have a single node status file for an entire workflow, even if that workflow has subdag externals in it.\n\n<p>We need to think about this carefully before we do it, though.  There are some issues such as:\n</p><ul>\n<li>What to do about possible node name collisions (maybe prefix the node names with the subdag name, as we do for splices?).\n</li><li>Does this idea even really make sense?\n</li><li>What will happen when nodes are <strong>added</strong> to the node status file when a subdag is run?  Currently, the list of files in the node status file never changes.  Will changes break any code that relies on the node status file?\n</li><li>How would this be implemented?  That may be a little tricky...</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Dec-06 13:35", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Dec-06 13:35", "fixed_version": "2011-Dec-06 13:35", "broken_version": "v070704", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
