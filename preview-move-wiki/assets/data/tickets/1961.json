{"id": 1961, "title": "Ticket #1961: \"Node not found\" message should know about retries", "description": "<blockquote>\nI have a fix ready for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1957\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1957'); return false;\" title=\"Node job failure/retries/slow aborted event/recovery mode cause error\">#1957</a></span>, which will result in a \"node not found\" message in the series of events that produce the problem.  Pete and I talked about this, and we want to have a different message when a Condor ID belongs to a previous submission of a given node, versus belonging to a job that is not a node job of the current DAG at all.  Our current idea is to either have a stack of CondorIDs in the Job object, or else a sort of \"dummy\" job object that holds IDs of previous submissions of a node.  I'm just going to do the simple fix for 7.6.0, and we'll aim to get the more comprehensive fix into 7.7.0.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Mar-05 10:11:19 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nI don't understand this ticket, and I don't think it's a big issue for us, so I'm bumping it to priority==4.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-05 10:26:07 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\n4 is triage state.
