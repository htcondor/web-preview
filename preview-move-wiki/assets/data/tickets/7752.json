{"id": 7752, "title": "Ticket #7752: RPM installs fail without adding EPEL repo", "description": "<blockquote>\nAt least on Centos7, any attempt to install HTCondor RPMs fails because the of an undeclared dependency on packages from the EPEL repository. The breaking change appears to have happened back in v8.8.4 with ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6327\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6327'); return false;\" title=\"Build system should create bindings for both Python2 and Python3\">#6327</a></span> <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/94a0f06ba3400adfde1a5243a5dacc677102bfe9\">[57288]</a></span>.\nI am not enough of a packaging expert to say if this should be fixed via documentation, or if it is acceptable to simply have the HTCondor RPMs add the EPEL repo as a dependency (hoping adding EPEL as a dependency is acceptable practice).  But currently following our documentation that says how to install HTCondor RPMs results in failure.\n\n<p>For example, here are the errors reported when trying to do a <code>yum install minicondor</code> on a Centos7 image:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>   --&gt; Finished Dependency Resolution\nError: Package: python2-condor-8.8.9-1.el7.x86_64 (htcondor-stable)\n           Requires: boost169-python2\nError: Package: python3-condor-8.8.9-1.el7.x86_64 (htcondor-stable)\n           Requires: libboost_python36.so.1.69.0()(64bit)\nError: Package: python3-condor-8.8.9-1.el7.x86_64 (htcondor-stable)\n           Requires: boost169-python3\nError: Package: python2-condor-8.8.9-1.el7.x86_64 (htcondor-stable)\n           Requires: libboost_python27.so.1.69.0()(64bit)</pre>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Jul-24 12:26:45 by matyas:</em> <br/>\n\nSoftware packages adding repos is unfortunately not acceptable practice, so this will have to be fixed in documentation.\n\n<p>Note that in CentOS 8, in addition to EPEL, users have to enable the <code>PowerTools</code> repo by editing <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-PowerTools.repo</code> and setting <code>enabled=1</code>\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Jul-24 13:46:21 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nUgh, so painful.
