I know my test does not need a collector, so I didn't bother setting one up in my condor_config.  I'm now using the condor_config with CondorPersonal.pm.  Unfortunately CondorPersonal.pm checks in an infinite loop for the collector to appear (IsRunningYet(), CondorPersonal.pm:1295).  This took a while to debug.\n\n<p>Possible improvements:\n</p><ul>\n<li>After waiting for \"a while\", emit a fatal error.  \"Could not find collector's address; it may not be running.  <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CondorPersonal\" title=\"Condor Personal\">CondorPersonal</a></span> requires a collector be configured.\n</li><li>Check DAEMON_LIST, and if COLLECTOR isn't there, emit a fatal error.\n</li><li>Check DAEMON_LIST, and if COLLECTOR isn't there, add it automatically.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>There is almost certainly an identical problem with the negotiator, and perhaps other daemons.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 14:27", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-29 15:36", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-29 15:36", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "bt", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
