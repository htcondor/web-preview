It has enough file entries to catch the condor_submit issue which is now fixed. Over time we will attempt to cover\nall possible submit file entries using a number of submit files. Also in time we will ensure we got onto the job ads with the entries.\n\n<p></p></li><li>The second test will have 1000 plus unique entries which will grow as we generate the file. There will be enough regular entries to allow the job to submit. The latter unique entries will have around 1000 characters for their value.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>In neither case do we care if the job runs.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Mar-20 11:12</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f070da6490d44bde5da2adb7d384adfd337645a2\">[39667]</a></span>: Add increased memory error.
