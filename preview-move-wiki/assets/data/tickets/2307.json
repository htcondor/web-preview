You do not want to update Condor...\n\nIf you do really want to, start here:\n\n        /exports/condor/condor-7.1.1-linux-x86_64-rhel5/\n\nAnd look at all of the .patch files.\n\nIf you have a source tree I can look at porting the patches and seeing\nwhich still apply, but it is going to take some time.  It has always\nbeen my intention to get these patches into the Condor development\ntree, so this would be a good opportunity to get that going.\n\n--\nDan\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-14 16:05:45 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThank god, we finally got them in some form other than a stapled together and marked up hardcopy that was predictably and easily lost 5 minutes after we got it.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/414/forrest-patches.tgz\">forrest-patches.tgz</a>\n271178 bytes added by nwp on 2011-Jul-14 20:34:53 UTC.\n<br/>\nThe attachment contains the patches<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-22 10:17", "status": "active", "created": "2011-Jul-14 15:34", "fixed_version": "2011-Jul-14 15:34", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#2", "creator": "nwp", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu,tannenba@cs.wisc.edu,dan.forrest@ssec.wisc.edu,psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
