{"id": 3080, "title": "Ticket #3080: dprintf smart handling of newlines", "description": "<blockquote>\ndprintf always prints the timestamp when called.  So it should always print a newline at the end.  However, it doesn't, it expects the caller to get it right.  That's just silly, because occasionally someone will forget the terminal newline and you'll get output like this:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \n06/21/12 16:08:12 DaemonCore: async_pipe is signalled, but async_pipe_signal is false.06/21/12 16:08:12 DaemonCore: async_pipe is signalled, but async_pipe_signal is false.06/21/12 16:08:12 DaemonCore: async_pipe is signalled, but async_pipe_signal is false.06/21/12 16:08:12 DaemonCore: async_pipe is signalled, but async_pipe_signal is false.06/21/12 16:08:12 DaemonCore: async_pipe is signalled, but async_pipe_signal is false.06/21/12 16:08:12 DaemonCore: async_pipe is signalled, but async_pipe_signal is false.06/21/12 16:08:12 DaemonCore: async_pipe is signalled, but async_pipe_signal is false.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>Proposed: dprintf should check if the last character is \\n.  If it isn't, it should automatically append a \\n.  Then for the sake of simplicity and a very small image size savings, we should do a quick removal of the now unnecessary newlines and use the newline free form going forward.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Jun-21 17:44:40 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nIf we're going to be rocking the boot, why not also rename dprintf to \"log\"?</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Jun-21 17:44", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jun-21 17:40", "fixed_version": "2012-Jun-21 17:40", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
