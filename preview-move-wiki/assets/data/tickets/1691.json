{"id": 1691, "title": "Ticket #1691: Gridmanager should use DelegatedProxyExpiration for cream jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe gridmanager uses job attribute <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DelegatedProxyExpiration\" title=\"Delegated Proxy Expiration\">DelegatedProxyExpiration</a></span> to avoid refreshing proxies to all gram2 jobs on restart. Without this attribute, on restart, the gridmanager doesn't know when the previously-delegated proxy will expire. Refreshing proxies for all jobs is an expensive operation to be avoided if possible.\n\n<p>With Cream, there's only one proxy delegated for many jobs, so refreshing it is inexpensive for the gridmanager. But it's very expensive on the Cream side when it has to push the proxy out to hundreds or thousands of jobs. Thus, the gridmanager should use the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DelegatedProxyExpiration\" title=\"Delegated Proxy Expiration\">DelegatedProxyExpiration</a></span> attribute for Cream jobs to avoid unnecessary proxy refreshes on a restart.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:50:47 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:20:02 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:25", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Oct-05 10:51", "fixed_version": "2010-Oct-05 10:51", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
