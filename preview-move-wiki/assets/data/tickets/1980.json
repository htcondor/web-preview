I don't have credentials stashed for any user as all the execute nodes run jobs as the AD account that the Condor service is logged in as. I expected this to happen for the DAGMan jobs I submitted as well, but this isn't the case.\n\n<p>The scheduler universe seems to ignore the fact that <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RunAsOwner\" title=\"Run As Owner\">RunAsOwner</a></span> = False in the job ad and that Condor is logged in as an AD user already. It immediately puts all DAGMan jobs on hold complaining that the user has no credentials on the machine (which is true).\n\n</p><p>Is there a way around this? I'd really just like it to run the jobs as the user it happens to be logged in as.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2011-Mar-17 12:11", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Mar-17 12:11", "fixed_version": "2011-Mar-17 12:11", "broken_version": "v070404", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "ichesal", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "ichesal@cyclecomputing.com", "due_date": ""}
