{"id": 2963, "title": "Ticket #2963: DAGman  maxSubmits overrides maxIdle", "description": "<blockquote>\nBT reports that if DAGMAN_MAX_SUBMIT_ATTEMPTS is large and DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE is small, then the DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE throttle is basically forced to be the same as DAGMAN_MAX_SUBMIT_ATTEMPTS.  This makes sense in looking at the code.  Not sure that this is an error, as it can be fixed by setting DAGMAN_MAX_SUBMIT_ATTEMPTS less than DAGMAN_MAX_JOBS_IDLE, but it is a surprise.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jan-29 14:06", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Apr-30 11:01", "fixed_version": "2012-Apr-30 11:01", "broken_version": "v070706", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "", "creator": "nwp", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu tannenba@cs.wisc.edu bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
