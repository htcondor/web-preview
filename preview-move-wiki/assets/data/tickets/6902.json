Greg tells me this was for historical reasons, so people could easily spot rogue Condor jobs using resources on their desktops.\n\n<p>This causes problems with programs that use argv[0] to make decisions -- for example, the Python interpreter looks at the path to figure out where to look for its libraries.  (This doesn't bite most people because it only happens when the Executable is python, not if it's a script with #!python.)\n\n</p><p>This causes more trouble than it's worth so we should stop doing it.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Sep-09 09:52", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Feb-06 11:19", "fixed_version": "2019-Feb-06 11:19", "broken_version": "v040000", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "matyas", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matyas@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
