{"id": 877, "title": "Ticket #877: NumSystemHolds not incremented when schedd holds scheduler univ jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen a scheduler universe job's executable doesn't exist, the schedd puts the job on hold, but doesn't increment <span class=\"quote\">NumSystemHolds</span> in the job ad. If the job has a <span class=\"quote\">PeriodicRelease</span> referencing <span class=\"quote\">NumSystemHolds</span>, it doesn't behave as expected.\n\n<p>For example, the <span class=\"quote\">PeriodicRelease</span> expression for condor_dagman is (<span class=\"quote\">NumSystemHolds</span> &lt;= 3). If the condor_dagman executable isn't present (say because the admin moved the Condor release dir as part of an upgrade), the dagman job will go into an infinite hold/release cycle.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Oct-22 13:45", "fixed_version": "2009-Oct-22 13:45", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
