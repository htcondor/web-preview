{"id": 7888, "title": "Ticket #7888: Document how X509 user proxy type determines delegated proxy type", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt has now happened enough times in LIGO that we think it would be useful to document that if a user specifies to use a proxy, and the indicated proxy is NOT of type \"RFC 3820 compliant impersonation proxy\", then the delegated proxy that condor will create for each such job will be of type \"Proxy draft (pre-RFC) compliant limited proxy.\" For an increasing number of consumers of proxies, this will not be accepted.  In such a case, the original proxy needs to be created as an RFC 3820 compliant proxy.  Given the limited remaining usefulness of proxies we are not requesting a change in behavior, but just that this behavior be documented, since otherwise it has proven time-consuming to track down anew on multiple occasions.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2021-Apr-13 10:49", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2020-Oct-27 10:50", "fixed_version": "2020-Oct-27 10:50", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jlwillis", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "jlwillis@caltech.edu, macleoddm@cardiff.ac.uk, pcouvare@caltech.edu, sba@caltech.edu, james.clark@physics.gatech.edu", "due_date": ""}
