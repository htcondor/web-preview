Only the grouping aspect of this should be hard -- <code>condor_q</code> doesn't do that right now.\n\n<p>The grouping aspect may first show up in the idea that the USER column should be the default group attribute (argument to GROUP BY), and the first group attribute (maybe only as a special case for USER) should be printed above each group, and the redundant attribute omitted from the columns.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Jun-19 16:02", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Jun-19 16:02", "fixed_version": "2017-Jun-19 16:02", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
