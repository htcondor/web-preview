{"id": 2309, "title": "Ticket #2309: 32bit schedd crashing repeatedly, 64bit schedd works ok", "description": "<blockquote>\nSays Igor:\n\n<p>Over the weekend our Condor 7.6.0 32bit schedd started crashing.\nAt first once every couple hours, then every few minutes!\n\n</p><p>We had about 10k jobs running and another 10k idle in that period.\n\n</p><p>I then tried to upgrade to 7.6.1 (still 32bit), and the schedd would still keep crashing.\n\n</p><p>I then went with 7.6.1 64bit, and that seemed to solve the problem.\nI.e. it was not crashing anymore.\n\n</p><p>Now, I don't know how to have you reproduce the problem.\nSince this was happening on a production system, the first priority was to get the system back in shape, so there was little debugging performed.\n\n</p><p>RUST ticket includes sample of emails I received from the Master. The first and the last crash in the series are included.\nHope this helps you somehow. Else, at least you know this can happen.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Jul-28 13:07:54 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nAppears to be very stale - closing out.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2014-Jul-28 13:08", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2011-Jul-18 13:48", "fixed_version": "2011-Jul-18 13:48", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "s8066", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, sfiligoi@fnal.gov, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
