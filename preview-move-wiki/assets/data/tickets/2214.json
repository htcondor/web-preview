The master branch works fine without it, but it leaves an IPv4-only function call in the path.\n\n</p><p>It is entirely possible that the problem is a transient BATLab problem, or perhaps a problem with that specific machine.  Steps forward might be: rebuild/retest, possibly forcing a different x86_rhas_3 machine; log into the BATLab's machine and test manually.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Jul-29 10:27:51 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nAbandoned.
