I have historically kept long history logs on the head nodes. My previous settings enabled 100 days of history with no file greater than 1GB in size. In practice, a day's worth of history is never near 1GB. It's just there to go above the default 20MB decisively.\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>ENABLE_HISTORY_ROTATION = True\nROTATE_HISTORY_DAILY    = True\nMAX_HISTORY_LOG         = 1000000000\nMAX_HISTORY_ROTATIONS   = 100\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>But these settings suddenly became problematic because these jobs were creating 10 1GB files per day!
