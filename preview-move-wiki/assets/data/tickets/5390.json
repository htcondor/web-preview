The error is a nuisance for automatically creating the JSON; we need to special case to emit a comma before adding a new entry, but not if we're adding the first entry.\n\n</p><p>Should be pretty easy, less than an hour's work.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Nov-16 15:12:32 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nDone. Also added some tests for various types of input we should read to ensure we can still read them.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Nov-23 13:24:15 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nPull request made upstream.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Nov-23 13:24", "status": "resolved", "created": "2015-Nov-11 14:34", "fixed_version": "2015-Nov-11 14:34", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "#5351", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
