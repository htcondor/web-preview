This seems of limited utility in a controlled\nenvironment.  The libvirt docs talk about setting up the bridge interface on\nthe host OS, and it seems a much more useful use case for the box admin to\nsetup the bridged networking interfaces for a machine that will run VMs with\nbridged networking.\n\n</p><p>It is likely that VM_BRIDGE_SCRIPT is a hold over from before the libvirt\nconversion, when condor used the xen API directly.  Additionally, dynamic\ninterface creation and destruction could be handled, much cleaner, via the\nstartd hooks.\n\n</p><p>Perhaps the job submit files should be allowed to specify which bridge\ninterface to use, with the administrator able to define a default in condor's\nconfiguration, for a case where multiple bridge interfaces could exist on a\nstartd.  The creation of all the interfaces would be the responsibility of the\nadmin (via hooks or explicit OS configuration).\n\n</p><p>Given all the above, it seems removing/deprecating the VM_BRIDGE_SCRIPT is the\nroute to take, along with providing documentation on how to configure a bridge\nnetworking on the host.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-May-13 14:38:38 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe patch looks alright to me.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-May-14 11:41:51 by rrati:</em> <br/>\n\nChanges to documentation in ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1407\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1407'); return false;\" title=\"VM Universe Bridge Params update\">#1407</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/173/vm_universe_bridge_networking.patch\">vm_universe_bridge_networking.patch</a>\n10612 bytes added by rrati on 2010-May-12 20:54:13 UTC.\n<br/>\nThis patch adds a new param VM_NETWORKING_BRIDGE_INTERFACE that must be set if bridged networking is to be used with libvirt.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-May-14 11:35</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/7388eee7fe26219783ea60683367cb74fc967007\">[17996]</a></span>: Added configuration for a console for all VMs started in libvirt (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1402\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1402'); return false;\" title=\"VM universe: issues with bridged networking\">#1402</a></span>)  (By Robert Rati )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-May-14 11:35</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/eb3e93041a084a8f73dd39c469dee550f9c7a4eb\">[17995]</a></span>: Fixes numerous issues with VM Universe and bridge networking (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1402\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1402'); return false;\" title=\"VM universe: issues with bridged networking\">#1402</a></span>): 1) Removed VM_BRIDGE_SCRIPT param, as it was useless 2) Added VM_NETWORKING_BRIDGE_INTERFACE param, which MUST be set if bridged networking is to be enabled.
