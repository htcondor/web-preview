{"id": 84, "title": "Ticket #84: Condor's init script should start the Master as non-root when PrivSep", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis is not too much of a concern given that the Master drops to CONDOR_PRIV and restarts itself if needed. Yet it would still be an improvement for Condor's init script to detect when <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> is configured (via PRIVSEP_ENABLED in the Condor configuration) and start Condor as the appropriate non-root UID in that case.\n\n<p>This is particularly useful in setups like our CS pool that have a Master wrapper script, since it would be nice if the wrapper script didn't have to worry about sometimes being started as root (on boot) and sometimes being started as condor (on restart).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:20", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-23 16:22", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-23 16:22", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "nleroy", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
