{"id": 1193, "title": "Ticket #1193: Better handling of full checkpoint server", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently checkpoints are removed from the checkpoint server if the job completes or 60 days (configurable) pass without updates. In a disk full situation new checkpoints are just dropped. We can do better.\n\n<p>Proposal: give checkpoints short leases, may 14 days by default. A schedd will ping the checkpoint server every lease/10 days, updating the lease. When the lease expires, the checkpoint is not necessarily removed. A checkpoint is removed after 60 days of inactivity (still configurable), <em>or</em> if the lease is expired and disk space available is \"low\" (% used for checkpoints versus configurable size limit, or perhaps if disk as a whole is over 90% full).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Feb-09 11:31", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Feb-09 11:31", "fixed_version": "2010-Feb-09 11:31", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
