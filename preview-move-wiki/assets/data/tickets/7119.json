{"id": 7119, "title": "Ticket #7119: condor_qedit reports one too many matching jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nRaytheon is reporting that condor_qedit reports the wrong number of matching jobs.

I've changed this to count cluster ads + jobs separately. If there is more than one job match, then the job count is returned. If there are no job matches but there is a cluster match, the cluster match count is returned. If there are no matches at all, it returns an error.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Aug-01 17:11:15 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE_REVIEW</strong> looks good.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Aug-05 16:48</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/8ccec62bff444e0d9abebf4f9830d404488d1096\">[57597]</a></span>: Added version history (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7119\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7119'); return false;\" title=\"condor_qedit reports one too many matching jobs\">#7119</a></span>)  (By Mark Coatsworth )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Jul-05 12:15</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/dbe07d4632617a9a19943309e0a3e145af9f9e7a\">[57323]</a></span>: Changed qedit to count jobs and cluster ads separately (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7119\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7119'); return false;\" title=\"condor_qedit reports one too many matching jobs\">#7119</a></span>)  (By Mark Coatsworth )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-Aug-05 16:49", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-Jun-20 12:52", "fixed_version": "2019-Jun-20 12:52", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "", "creator": "coatsworth", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
