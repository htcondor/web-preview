But in the batlab with\ncygwin extracted from path it works...... We don't want folks to have to install\ncygwin to test on windows.\n\n<p>The issue was that we were using `date` in the testiing perl modules. Without cygwin, this waits for a persona to change the date. These calls were all removed and we run fine on windows now.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Oct-02 11:27", "status": "resolved", "created": "2014-Sep-19 12:08", "fixed_version": "2014-Sep-19 12:08", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "bt", "derived_from": "#4520", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
