{"id": 4348, "title": "Ticket #4348: CONDOR_IDS should be ignored if not running as root", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen running with root priv, CONDOR_IDS tells condor what UID/GID to use during normal operation.  However, if you start condor without root, it should really have no effect.  For the most part, that's true, but a call to get_real_condor_uid() returns the value from CONDOR_IDS even though this can never be the case, as a non-root install can't switch to said UID.  This can lead to problems operating on jobs because <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=OwnerCheck\" title=\"Owner Check\">OwnerCheck</a></span> will fail, and the resulting message is entirely non-obvious.  There's no good reason that I can think of to look at CONDOR_IDS in a non-root install, and as such I propose to modify the code so it is ignore in such a scenario.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Mar-02 15:47", "status": "new", "created": "2014-May-07 15:43", "fixed_version": "2014-May-07 15:43", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "fermi", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
