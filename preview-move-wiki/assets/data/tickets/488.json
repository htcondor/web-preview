{"id": 488, "title": "Ticket #488: [RFE] $([])", "description": "<blockquote>\nContext: log = $$([$(Process)+100]).log\n\n<p>There are some subtleties with $$().  It is only evaluated after the job\nis matched to a machine.  That's too late for choosing the log file, but\nnot too late for other things, such as the arguments (which is what I\nassumed you were trying to set).\n\n</p><p>$$() is evaluated after matching and $() is evaluated at submit time.\nWe are only using $$() in this case because it happens to support\nevaluation of arbitrary expressions via $$([expr]) syntax.  We don't\nneed access to attributes of the machine in this expression, so it is\ntoo bad that something like $([expr]) isn't supported.  That would do\nthe trick nicely.\n\n</p><p>--Dan</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-May-26 11:44", "status": "new", "created": "2009-May-15 09:46", "fixed_version": "2009-May-15 09:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu, eje@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
