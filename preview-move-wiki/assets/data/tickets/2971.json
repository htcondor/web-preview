These servers can be quite busy, and it would be useful to be able to limit the size of the stdout/stderr coming back from the job.  We don't want to limit <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DiskUsage\" title=\"Disk Usage\">DiskUsage</a></span> for the job itself, since the actual output files get staged elsewhere, but it is possible for CMS users to accidentally generate multi-GB stdout and stderr.\n\n<p>Additionally, if we do hit a size limit, I think we'd like to tail rather than truncate, since that's marginally more likely to have useful information in it.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-May-04 13:31", "status": "new", "created": "2012-May-04 10:10", "fixed_version": "2012-May-04 10:10", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "burt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "burt@fnal.gov, ewv@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
