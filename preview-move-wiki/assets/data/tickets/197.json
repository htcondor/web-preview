{"id": 197, "title": "Ticket #197: Reduce frequency of DAGMan sleeps for log file consistency", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight now, if there are multiple log files, we sleep for one second before <strong>every</strong> submit (so that we can be sure to get events in the right order in recovery mode, because the timestamps are only precise to 1s).  I'm pretty sure that we can relax this to just doing a sleep before each <strong>cycle</strong> of submits, because I don't think it really matters if we get the submit events for sibling jobs in the exact right order, as long as we don't get a submit event for a job before the terminated event of its parent.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nFixed for 7.3.0.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2021-Aug-18 08:05</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=64139\">[64139]</a></span>: Merged <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=64137\">[64137]</a></span>, <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=64138\">[64138]</a></span>, Merge branch 'V9_1-HTCONDOR-629-branch' condor_adstash PR#197 - Removes limit on max ads and fixes some config checks.
