{"id": 3762, "title": "Ticket #3762: Suspend creates unpredictable results", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf the <code>SUSPEND</code> expression in the startd becomes true, it is possible for the starter and shadow to become disconnected with a vanilla job.  Once this happens, reconnects also fail, and the job will go back to idle. This happens about 30% of the time in testing.\n\n<p>A suspend will cause unpredictable results. In the test we have to do suspend and then continues until the job complete, we get some success and some failure. I have seen shadow exceptions. I have also seen it be taken by a disconnect by the shadow which then focusses on trying to reconnect without success.\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  07/09/13 11:34:16 Entering JICShadow::updateShadow()\n  07/09/13 11:34:16 In VanillaProc::PublishUpdateAd()\n  07/09/13 11:34:16 Inside OsProc::PublishUpdateAd()\n  07/09/13 11:34:16 Inside UserProc::PublishUpdateAd()07/09/13 11:34:16 In VanillaProc::PublishUpdateAd()\n  07/09/13 11:34:16 Inside OsProc::PublishUpdateAd()\n  07/09/13 11:34:16 Inside UserProc::PublishUpdateAd()07/09/13 11:34:16 Sent job ClassAd update to startd.\n  07/09/13 11:34:16 Leaving JICShadow::updateShadow(): success\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 Suspending all jobs. 07/09/13 11:34:32 in VanillaProc::Suspend()\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 In VanillaProc::PublishUpdateAd()\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here is sample log output from the shadow\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): condor_read(): Socket closed when trying to read 5 bytes from startd slot5@ingwe.cs.wisc.edu\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): IO: EOF reading packet header\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): Can no longer talk to condor_starter &lt;128.105.121.64:41723&gt;\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): FileLock::obtain(1) - @1373387672.031265 lock on /tmp/condorLocks/17/73/02219024403982.lockc now WRITE\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): FileLock::obtain(2) - @1373387672.031324 lock on /tmp/condorLocks/17/73/02219024403982.lockc now UNLOCKED\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): Trying to reconnect job schedd10644suspendandcontinue@ingwe.cs.wisc.edu#2.0#1373387630\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): Trying to reconnect to disconnected job\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): LastJobLeaseRenewal: 1373387656 Tue Jul 9 11:34:16 2013 07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): JobLeaseDuration: 1200 seconds\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): Resource slot5@ingwe.cs.wisc.edu changing state from EXECUTING to RECONNECT\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): JobLeaseDuration remaining: 1184\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): Attempting to locate disconnected starter\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): gjid is schedd10644suspendandcontinue@ingwe.cs.wisc.edu#2.0#1373387630 claimid is &lt;128.105.121.64:41723&gt;#1373387607#10#...\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): attempt to connect to &lt;128.105.121.64:41723&gt; failed: Connection refused (connect errno = 111).\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): locateStarter(): Failed to connect to startd &lt;128.105.121.64:41723&gt;\n  07/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): JobLeaseDuration remaining: 1200 0\n  7/09/13 11:34:32 (2.0) (10866): Scheduling another attempt to reconnect in 8 seconds</pre>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nThe test job_basic_suspend_continue_test.run has been turned off till this gets fixed.
