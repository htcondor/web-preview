{"id": 132, "title": "Ticket #132: Fix gittrac style sheet for Internet Explorer", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe gittrac Condor cusomized style sheet and header look like <strong>crap</strong> on Internet Explorer.  The menu items on the header of the page are all messed up. Be real nice to fix this.\n\n<p>The style sheet and header customizations look fine on Firefox and Safari; dunno about Chrome, but prolly fine since Safari and Chrome both use <span class=\"quote\">WebKit</span>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Feb-18 13:52:19 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nTristan put about 30 minutes into it, no luck.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-25 12:11:11 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, now the page looks OK in IE, but CR/LFs do not display in the edit boxes!!!  How this is even possible to mess up I have no idea.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Mar-05 14:01:28 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSo the problem with CR/LF not working in edit boxes on IE seems to be related to upstream commits documented <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cvstrac.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=729\">here</a>.  Upstream they know they still have problems to work out here.\n\n<p>For the time being, I made a quick hack in our version of the code to work around the problem.\n\n</p><p>Since things now seem to work decently enough on IE, I am closing this ticket.  We are one step closer to making this site public in time for Condor Week 2009! whoot.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Feb-03 08:19", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jan-27 15:49", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-27 15:49", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "#3", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
