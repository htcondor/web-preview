{"id": 2493, "title": "Ticket #2493: avoid sending jobs to sites where glexec fails with the supplied proxy", "description": "<blockquote>\nwhen sites use glexec, it is possible that glexec will fail for a number of reasons and the job will not be started.  at the moment, this causes that individual job to go on hold.  however, if that user has submitted thousands of jobs, condor needs to do something more intelligent so we do not attempt to launch more jobs at the same site with the same proxy.  possibilities could include rate limiting (exponential backoff?) or blacklisting (with a timeout).  a major challenge seems to be knowing ahead of time that glexec will fail, and i think we need to be careful here.  i posit that a single glexec failure should not cause blacklisting of a site.  also, how do we know which machines are grouped together in a single \"site\" from the glexec perspective?</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Jan-30 14:55", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Sep-22 14:08", "fixed_version": "2011-Sep-22 14:08", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "#2753", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
