{"id": 7867, "title": "Ticket #7867: condor_submit_as_dag should use Python API", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, <code>condor_submit_as_dag</code> calls the <code>condor_submit</code> command-line tool.  It would be nice to use the Python API instead.  This proved too tricky to do in timer for 8.9.9, but may prove possible with further investigation.\n\n<p>Obtaining the itemdata is straightforward, but useless without the queue count and the variable names.  Some experimentation will be necessary to determine if the queue count in the original submit file is always preserved (through simplification); if the itemdata specifies the variable names and/or they can be reliably obtained through parsing the queue statment; and if the itemdata returned by the API implicitly includes the queue count or not.\n\n</p><p>Deferring until <code>condor_submit_as_dag</code> sees enough usage to warrant the further work.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Sep-28 16:55", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Sep-28 16:55", "fixed_version": "2020-Sep-28 16:55", "broken_version": "v080909", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#7747", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
