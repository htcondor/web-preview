We decided to\nuse SOAP-Lite-0.715 for now for our Perl based SOAP. So after using wget to extract the sources from our externals location we build and install the Perl\nmodules into the folder we are running in. Then we edit the script we will run to\ntest so it is looking at this freshly installed SOAP-Lite.\n\n</p><p>The personal HTCondor configures the SOAP interfaces in HTCondor.\n\n</p><p>The schedd port is discovered by finding the htcondor log directory and then\nparsing the port out of the first line in the \".schedd_address\" file.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jul-29 13:51", "status": "stalled", "created": "2013-Apr-19 15:30", "fixed_version": "2013-Apr-19 15:30", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "bt", "derived_from": "#3594", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn.cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
