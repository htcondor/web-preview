{"id": 6512, "title": "Ticket #6512: Add debugging dryrun code to negotiatior", "description": "<blockquote>\nDebugging issues with the negotiation can be a lot of work to set up.  Let's add some code that allows the negotiation to read in classads describing demand and supply, and print out what it would do, without requiring waiting for negotiation cycles, and setting up jobs and machines.\n\n<p>For a first cut, I'm adding a command-line option (-z) to the negotiation that forces it to read in config, demand and supply from the collector as usual, then immediately run one cycle and exit.  This helps debugging immensely.  Leaving jobs in the queue with requirements = false lets you re-run negotiation cycles without anything else changing.\n\n</p><p>Note this is just for developers, so we don't need docs or version history.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Dec-15 10:38</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/d887dec3275896a6320835451b6b7d5e446ffd4e\">[53014]</a></span>: Add debugging dryrun mode to negotiator <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6512\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6512'); return false;\" title=\"Add debugging dryrun code to negotiatior\">#6512</a></span> Not completely finished, but enough to be useful  (By Greg Thain )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-Feb-19 15:43", "status": "resolved", "created": "2017-Dec-15 10:37", "fixed_version": "2017-Dec-15 10:37", "broken_version": "v080700", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
