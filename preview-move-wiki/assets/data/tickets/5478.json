The old format is a resource identifier followed by an\n8-character string, and the new format is a resource identifier followed\nby a 17-character string. You have until December 2016 to opt in to the\nlonger format.\n\nIf you do not take any action, you will be opted in automatically on\nDecember 2016, when all new instance IDs and Reservation IDs will be\ncreated with the longer format. Until the deadline, you can opt in and\nout of the new format as needed. Only newly created resources receive\nlonger IDs; existing resources are unaffected.\n\nManage your transition to longer instance IDs and reservation IDs with\nResource ID length management\n&lt;https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#IdFormatSettings:&gt;,\nand read more about the new format &lt;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids&gt;.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>According to the above FAQ, we can turn long IDs off and back on again on a per-IAM user basis, so testing should be easy.  I don't anticipate any problems, except perhaps with the 'condor_q -grid' pretty-printer.\n\n</p><p>Deadline is from the FAQ and is when the shorter IDs will no longer be available.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Sep-09 13:54:26 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>&gt; except perhaps with the 'condor_q -grid' pretty-printer.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Sure enough, the longer instance IDs don't fit in the assigned column, and it's not easy to tell that they've been truncated.
