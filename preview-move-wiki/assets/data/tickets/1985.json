If condor_submit and the schedd are on the same machine, that write and the subsequent spooling of the user log will be successful. Otherwise, both actions will fail.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-22 16:46:09 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nFor a simple fix for 7.6.0, we can either delay the writing of the submit event until after the job ad is rewritten or move up the ad rewriting to just before the submit event is written. Either way, the schedd needs to know at transaction commit time whether files will be spooled. It can figure this out by looking at the <span class=\"quote\">JobStatus</span> (5, Held) and <span class=\"quote\">HoldReasonCode</span> (16, <span class=\"quote\">SpoolingInput</span>). Also, condor_submit should not spool the user log (unless it's writing the submit event because it's talking to an old schedd).\n\n<p>Some additional work that should be considered:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>The schedd should never attempt to run a remote job with unspooled files. Condor_release should not work on such jobs. Should there be a new job status for these jobs? Or should spooling be part of the job submission? I.e., the job doesn't appear in the queue until spooling is complete.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-23 15:08:45 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nOne minor problem with the proposed solution: if the user log has events from previous jobs, then those events will be lost when condor_transfer_data is run. If we want to retain those events, we would have to delay the submit event logging until after the job's input files are spooled and have condor_submit send the user log as an input file if it exists.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-25 10:28:09 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nNew proposed patch for 7.6.0:\n<ul>\n<li>Delay logging of submit event until after input files are spooled, if spooling input files.\n</li><li>Prevent jobs waiting for input files to be spooled from being released.\n</li><li>Suppress logging of abort event when a job waiting for input files to be spooled is removed.\n</li><li>Automatically remove jobs which spend too much time waiting for input files to be spooled.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>This prevents loss of previous events in the user log when a remote job is submitted. It makes it more likely to have jobs in the queue which don't have any presence in the event log, but now those jobs can't be accidentally released.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-28 09:28:40 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nso for a user which exits on the schedd it works fine.

They assume the filename in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=UserLog\" title=\"User Log\">UserLog</a></span> attribute in the job ad is formatted for the local architecture. With my new patch, <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=UserLog\" title=\"User Log\">UserLog</a></span> should have path information stripped before any calls to InitializeUserLog().\n\n<p>As for the shadow error, I found a comment in condor_submit() that says Owner should always be set by the schedd rather than submit. But with the current code, what user is the shadow using as the job owner in this case? Hopefully, my new patch won't break in the same way.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-29 09:54:00 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nso there doesn't appear to be any error with users that exist, but the afore mentioned error still exists with unrecognized users\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-30 13:14:03 by cweiss:</em> <br/>\n\nPatch looks good to me.
