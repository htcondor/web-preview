In particular we're interacting with a third-party client with subtly different semantics than we expect.  Seeing the exact sequence of calls would make reproducing the problem easier.\n\n<p>I'm picturing something similar to the logging the condor_gridmanager can do for the GAHP traffic.\n\n</p><p>We might want to hook in to <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soapdoc2.html#tth_sEc19.36.1\">gSOAP's logging plugin</a>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:19:13 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:19", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Jul-26 12:35", "fixed_version": "2010-Jul-26 12:35", "broken_version": "v070402", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
