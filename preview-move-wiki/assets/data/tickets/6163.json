So I'm kind of wondering whether we should have a condor_submit_dag mode that, instead of exiting once the submit actually occurs, stays running and tails the dagman.out file until DAGMan exits, so that the user automatically sees error messages on their screen...\n\n<p>Note that we'd obviously have to <strong>not</strong> run in this mode for sub-DAG submits from DAGMan itself...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Feb-28 15:33:46 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- Lauren suggests that dagman.out is too verbose for this -- maybe we could have condor_submit_dag only print lines that are errors?</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Feb-28 15:33", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Feb-27 17:04", "fixed_version": "2017-Feb-27 17:04", "broken_version": "v080701", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, lmichael@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
