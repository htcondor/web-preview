{"id": 5990, "title": "Ticket #5990: fix file creation on submit for \"transfer_output_files\"", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, empty files are created in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=InitialDir\" title=\"Initial Dir\">InitialDir</a></span> for \"transfer_output_files\", stderr, and stdout. This creates the following issues:\n\n<p>Issue 1. When empty files exist, even for stderr and stdout, users frequently think their jobs finished and that their executable created their intended output file, but didn't add any contents to it. This makes troubleshooting very difficult and adds to unnecessary user confusion.\n\n</p><p>Issue 2. If the same filename is listed for \"transfer_input_files\" and \"transfer_output_files\", the input file is overwritten in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=InitialDir\" title=\"Initial Dir\">InitialDir</a></span> with an empty file of the same name. This is REALLY bad.\n\n</p><p>Proposed solution: Have HTCondor check for the pre-existence of the file (and check it's permissions?), and at least delete any empty files that are created, right after they're confirmed as writable.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2016-Nov-03 11:52", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Nov-03 11:52", "fixed_version": "2016-Nov-03 11:52", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "FileTransfer", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "lmichael", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
