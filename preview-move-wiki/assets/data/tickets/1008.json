{"id": 1008, "title": "Ticket #1008: Slot MATCHED when Schedd lacking WRITE authorization", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn a configuration where a Schedd (submit0) does not have WRITE authorization to a Startd (execute324), the submit0 schedd might be allocated a claim to a slot on execute324. The negotiator can put the slot into the Matched state, which the schedd will never be able to activate. The REQUEST_CLAIM will be rejected. It seems reasonable that on such a failure, the slots state can be moved out of Matched. This may be tricky to resolve given the current layering.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Aug-23 17:07:50 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070402 to v070404 using ./ticket_target_mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-27 16:39:01 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070404 to v070405 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-May-29 14:26", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Nov-30 11:15", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-30 11:15", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
