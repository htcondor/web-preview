So have something like the following:\n\n</p><p>...\n\n</p><p>Transfer_input_files = gsiftp://globus-host:2811/home/user/somefile, gsiftp://globus-host:2811/home/user/someotherfile\n\n</p><p>Transfer_output_files = gsiftp://globus-host:2811/home/user/someoutput\n\n</p><p>This seems to be pretty easy to do with Condor, since it just creates a GT4 xml job description, then submits it with GRAM to a GT4 resource. I modified condor_gridmanager/gt4job.C to check if files in the stage_in_list starts with the gsiftp scheme name, and if so, insert the url directly into the element of the fileStageIn/ Out.\n\n</p><p>I&amp;#8217;ve included a patch for how I did this, but I really can&amp;#8217;t find any information on how to get this into Condor, or whether this is even something you would like to include. The patch was against the condor 7.1.0 source.\n\n</p><p>Let me know what you think.\n\n</p><p>&amp;#8212;patrick</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jan-24 21:58:39 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nBe sure to get a CLA\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Apr-18 15:42:26 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nGRAM4 hasn't been supported for years.
