So on most of our nodes, the jobs successfully opened the files it needed locally.\n\n</p><p>However, on the bad subset of nodes, the open()s failed -- and apparently in that case, Condor helpfully (?) tries remote i/o as a fallback instead of failing.\n\n</p><p>At least in our case, this was unexpected and undesired given our want_remote_io=false directive, and led to thousands of jobs /appearing/ to run, but indefinitely consuming zero CPU while simultaneously blocked on i/o through the submit machine.\n\n</p><p>I suspect this will understandably get chalked up as \"won't fix because DMTCP is coming to save the day\", but I'm becoming more and more worried that the DMTCP hero has not yet arrived...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Mar-01 14:32:09 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nStandard universe has been in maintenance-only mode for some time, abandoning.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2018-Mar-01 14:37", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2013-Sep-10 15:58", "fixed_version": "2013-Sep-10 15:58", "broken_version": "v080002", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Std", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "pfc", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": ",pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
