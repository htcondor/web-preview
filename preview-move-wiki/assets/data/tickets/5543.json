I was seeing four lines of error messages before the daemon banner for all of daemons.  Two of them were the default local config directory (that is, $(LOCAL_DIR)/config) not existing.  It's unfortunate that there's two messages for the same problem, and that they show up even if I didn't specifically request a config directory, but it's at least something I can resolve by creating that directory.\n\n<p>The other two are similar, but failing on /home/condor/config, which I can't (as a normal user) test.  This shouldn't be happening (see above), but certainly shouldn't be being checked since I have CONDOR_CONFIG set in the environment.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2016-Mar-03 16:34", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Mar-03 16:34", "fixed_version": "2016-Mar-03 16:34", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
