{"id": 1917, "title": "Ticket #1917: collect final update information", "description": "<blockquote>\nMiron and Igor had a discussion and agreed that the following should be implemented:\n\n<p>The idea would be for the startd (or any other daemon, for that matter) to send a final classad before dying that would tell it is going away, why and provide any \"health stats\" as appropriate. (this could be part of the the \"deadvertise\" packet, but not necessarily)\n\n</p><p>Upon receiving this information, the collector would store this information somewhere (likely a log file), so one can audit what is going on in the system. This would be especially useful in very dynamic systems like the glideins, but also when \"green computing\" techniques are used.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-16 16:14", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Feb-16 16:14", "fixed_version": "2011-Feb-16 16:14", "broken_version": "v070700", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu,sfiligoi@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
