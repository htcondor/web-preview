{"id": 3830, "title": "Ticket #3830: Improve job runtime histograms", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe job runtime histograms have the potential to be really, really cool and a nice addition to our local monitoring (<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://t2.unl.edu/condor/\">http://t2.unl.edu/condor/</a>).  I haven't had a lot of time to play with them yet, but immediately realized that the bucket sizes are not useful to me (30Sec, 1Min, 3Min, 10Min, 30Min, 1Hr, 3Hr, 6Hr, 12Hr, 1Day, 2Day, 4Day, 8Day, 16Day).\n\n<p>The uneven bucket sizes are going to be problematic for creating a nice plot <strong>and</strong> I would want more buckets in the region of 1-36 hours.  Unfortunately, I suspect that given any two sysadmins, they would also request two different histogram bucket sizes.\n\n</p><p>So, suggested improvement: allow the bucket sizes to be something set by sysadmins.  If this meant blowing away the statistics on reconfigure-based changes, that's OK.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-May-13 11:11", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Aug-05 11:49", "fixed_version": "2013-Aug-05 11:49", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
