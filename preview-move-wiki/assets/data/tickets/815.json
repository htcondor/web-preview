{"id": 815, "title": "Ticket #815: Better support custom glideins", "description": "<blockquote>\nOur current glidein functionality is limited, but the general technique has been used in far more places.  Supporting every possible use of glidein isn't feasible, so we should provide better tools and documentation to help with custom deployments.  Identify how to build a custom glidein tarball and what sorts of details you need to worry about to get it running on the remote machine.  Perhaps provide a tool to help build it.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 14:52", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Oct-05 12:59", "fixed_version": "2009-Oct-05 12:59", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
