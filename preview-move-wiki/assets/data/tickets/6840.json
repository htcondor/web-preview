{"id": 6840, "title": "Ticket #6840: Finish separation of read and write qmgmt commands", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn HTCondor 7.5.0 (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=930\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('930'); return false;\" title=\"QMGMT_CMD is registered at READ access level\">#930</a></span>), we separated the QMGMT_CMD cedar command into two commands, one for read-only operations (QMGMT_READ_CMD) and one for operations that modify the job queue (QMGMT_WRITE_CMD). For backwards compatibility, clients can still start a QMGMT_READ_CMD command (which is just QMGMT_CMD renamed) and then promote it to a connection that will modify the queue. This is needless complexity at this point, and it makes it harder for us to change the schedd to not handle any read-only requests in-process. We should complete the separation of these two cedar commands.\n\n<p>Most clients of the schedd now employ a version check and will use QMGMT_WRITE_CMD when wanting to modify the job queue. But a few don't do this. They always use QMGMT_READ_CMD for modification requests. They are condor_shadow.std, condor_prio, and condor_preen. We can assume that condor_shadow.std and condor_preen will be the same version as the schedd, but condor_prio with -name can have version skew. Thus, we need to be careful about when we make QMGMT_READ_CMD only work for read-only connections.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6844\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6844'); return false;\" title=\"Assume all schedds support QMGMT_WRITE_CMD\">#6844</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nAssume all schedds support QMGMT_WRITE_CMD</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-May-14 06:35", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Dec-13 10:16", "fixed_version": "2018-Dec-13 10:16", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
