{"id": 6422, "title": "Ticket #6422: Simplify setting of blahp-specific job attributes", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe blahp supports a number of job attributes that have no direct equivalent in HTCondor. These attributes control aspects of how the job is submitted to the local batch system that are critical to many users. Chief among these are attributes controlling host and core counts for parallel jobs and CERequirements, which allows an admin to control arbitrary batch system job parameters.\n\n<p>Currently, the gridmanager doesn't pass these attributes to the blahp if they appear in the grid job ad. The user can force them to appear by prefixing their names with <code>Remote_</code>. But if the job passes through Condor-C or the Job Router, then the user has to add additional <code>Remote_</code> prefixes. This mess can be simplified by having the gridmanager always pass these attributes along to the blahp.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Oct-24 14:11:46 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>Looks good to me.
