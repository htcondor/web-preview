{"id": 716, "title": "Ticket #716: condor_c-gahp should assume -f to run in foreground", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe condor_c-gahp is built using <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DaemonCore\" title=\"Daemon Core\">DaemonCore</a></span> and defaults to daemonizing on startup.  Since the GAHP is intended to interact over stdin/stdout, this is pretty much always the wrong behavior.  It's a nuisance to clean up after if you're trying to test with the GAHP correctly and for the the -f option.\n\n<p>Proposed change: the condor_c-gahp should always use foreground behavior (as though it was run with -f)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 14:51", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Sep-04 13:11", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-04 13:11", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
