The Lab will give us basic statistics of what files got downloaded (but not by whom) each week from the yum repo.\n\n<p>So, the download system needs to get these lab generated emails, instead of Thawan, they need to be funneled to the right place next to the other download information, and there needs to be a script to create graphs out of them.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Mar-30 10:55:21 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nPoor Thawan is probably shuffling these off into a procmail folder somewhere. I havne't had the time to work on this. Ergo, it is going to be stalled.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2011-Mar-30 11:59", "status": "stalled", "created": "2010-May-11 14:55", "fixed_version": "2010-May-11 14:55", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "psilord", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
