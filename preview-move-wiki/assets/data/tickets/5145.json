{"id": 5145, "title": "Ticket #5145: Handle TCP_FORWARDING_HOST in AddressV1", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe don't currently handle TCP_FORWARDING_HOST in AddressV1.  (See <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=5339\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5339'); return false;\" title=\"TCP_FORWARDING_HOST disregarded.\">#5339</a></span> for our approach to handling it in the addrs parameter of the Sinful.)  Arguably, we should simply add the forwarding host as a new inbound route, but maybe that's actually better left to AddressV2 (since it wouldn't be symmetric with the original Sinful).\n\n<p>Also, get_sinful_public() should probably set noUDP when TCP_FORWARDING_HOST overwrites the primary address (and the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DaemonCore\" title=\"Daemon Core\">DaemonCore</a></span> code that does this not), in case anybody else actually ever calls get_sinful_public().</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Oct-23 10:40:41 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom the original ticket description: <em>The issue may be that TCP_FORWARDING_HOST is applied very late in the advertising process, and as such doesn't appear in the addrs parameter.</em>   TCP_FORWARDING_HOST not appearing in the addrs parameter is actually a serious bug now, because it will cause HTCondor to ignore TCP_FORWARDING_HOST when actually doing networking.
