Ideally Alan would try to reproduce them, then submit better tickets.\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>When launching condor_master, if it just fails to launch (such that exec() fails), it still takes a few seconds to notice. Should notice and return failure immediately.  Way to test: remove execute bit from condor_master. (I ran into this when I replaced condor_master with a wrapper to valgrind+condor_master and forgot to set the permissions.)\n</li><li>There appear to be a few \"sleep(2)\" and \"sleep(5)\"s scattered about.  Ideally spin loop with sleep(0) for 2/5 seconds checking too see if the thing you're interested in has happened and failing if you run out of time. This should speed up a bunch of tests by removing a lot of little delays.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2015-Jul-14 13:55", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jul-14 13:55", "fixed_version": "2015-Jul-14 13:55", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
