{"id": 5660, "title": "Ticket #5660: Build full manual on Fedora.", "description": "<blockquote>\nI just spend twenty minutes discovering that somebody else had committed buggy TeX to the manual.  It turned not to be so bad because it had happened to be committed recently, but I was thinking it'd be good software development practice to test building the manual regularly.\n\n<p>Unfortunately, not all of execute nodes can do so.  While we could build the manual on the submit node, instead, doing so for every build would be unnecessarily taxing; instead, it seems easier to limit the build to some particular platform('s execute nodes).  Since Fedora is already our designated/notorious \"touchy\" platform, it seems like a natural choice.\n\n</p><p>TJ thinks this is a good idea, as long as the manual build doesn't take all that long.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-May-05 15:13:35 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nProvisionally assigned to 8.5.6, so it (a) won't get lost and (b) will get done before the 8.6.0 release, which really should have a good manual.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-May-07 15:15:37 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nThe full manual is already build as part of the RPM builds on RHEL6 and RHEL7.
