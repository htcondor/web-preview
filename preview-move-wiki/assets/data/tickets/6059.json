We shouldn't give the unresponsive schedd a free pass just because prefetching is enabled.\n\n</p><p>We should add time spent prefetching (from when the first prefetch request is sent until the last request finishes, regardless of how many schedds we are processing in parallel) to the time spent negotiating with the schedd.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Dec-20 08:34", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Dec-20 08:34", "fixed_version": "2016-Dec-20 08:34", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
