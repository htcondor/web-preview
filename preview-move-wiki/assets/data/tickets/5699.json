{"id": 5699, "title": "Ticket #5699: job queue log corrupted with history file snippets", "description": "<blockquote>\nCERN observed the job_queue.log corrupted in such a way that it has snippets of the history file inserted into it.  Somehow the fd for the job queue and the history file got swapped!\n\n<p>Two theories came to mind:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>CERN was running <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/a2o/snoopy\">Snoopy logger</a> (specifically snoopy-1.7.10-1.el6) on this schedd instance, which audits activity via LD_PRELOAD and has caused bugs for us in the past.  Maybe it is again?\n\n<p></p></li><li>The code in HTCondor to append to the History file looks like it could continue to use a stdio File* buffer after it has been de-allocated in the event that there was a failure to write to the History file. If this File* address is reused by glibc (after rotating the job_queue.log for instance), we could potentially observe this bug.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>This ticket proposes patches to clean up the code that detects and handles failures to write to the history file.\n\n</p><p>P.S.
