{"id": 3645, "title": "Ticket #3645: reconcile differences in config files between condor rpm versions", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe UW/OSG/Fedora versions of the condor RPM have different versions of the config files / system scripts (condor_config, sysconfig, and init.d).\n\n<p>Find out what the differences are and reconcile them into unified versions that cover the functionality of the three.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-May-22 10:51:06 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nIIRC - the uw package installs to non-native locations.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-12 16:58:34 by edquist:</em> <br/>\n\nSee attached summary of config file differences.\n\n<p>Most of the differences are from the main condor_config, both variable definitions and comments...  Need to decide what is \"correct\" or \"best\" in each case.\n\n</p><p>The UW and OSG rpms use completely different init.d scripts... Probably we'll use whatever falls out of the init.d script improvements Brian L is working on.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-19 17:39:47 by edquist:</em> <br/>\n\nIn the FW packaging meeting today TJ mentioned that the config file in the UW rpm hasn't been revisited in quite some time... It'd be good to look over what's different in the OSG version, but it sounds like most likely the unified rpm will adopt the changes introduced there.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-19 07:04:32 by edquist:</em> <br/>\n\nI am attaching a handful of files here related to the condor_config changes\nI've made for the unified rpm.
