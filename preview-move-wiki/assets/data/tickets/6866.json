{"id": 6866, "title": "Ticket #6866: scitokens: Skip credd redirect to webpage", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe TOKENS/OAuth mode assumes a very specific behavior of the CREDMON - particularly that the user needs to go to a corresponding URL run on the schedd.\n\n<p>This is not true in the case of the OSG-Connect hosts, where the CREDMON has the private key needed to issue its own tokens.  I propose adding a new flag, <code>CREDMON_WEB_REDIRECT=[true||false]</code> (naming should be parallel with <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6862\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6862'); return false;\" title=\"scitokens: admin cannot define hostname:port of credmon webserver\">#6862</a></span>) that allows the credd to skip any web requests and just wait for the CREDMON_COMPLETE file.\n\n</p><p>With this, I think we can migrate the OSG-Connect setup to use the new TOKENS mode.\n\n</p><p>[Note: this ticket might be deeper than expected as we might need the jobs to start life on hold until the corresponding credential appears... Needs to be investigated by the implementer]</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Feb-07 21:17:36 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nIt seems that the credd redirect to webpage can be done for a single provider if <code>SEC_CREDENTIAL_PRODUCER</code> is set (provided you don't mind it's called \"scitokens\"; see  <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6909\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6909'); return false;\" title='scitokens: Do not force credential to be named \"scitokens.top\"'>#6909</a></span>).\n\n<p>It appears that <code>SEC_CREDENTIAL_PRODUCER</code> has undocumented magic values such as <code>CREDENTIAL_ALREADY_STORED</code> (see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=6091\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6091'); return false;\" title=\"DAGMan cannot submit jobs with AFS / Kerberos support enabled\">#6091</a></span>); I'd like to add more semantics:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>If <code>SEC_CREDENTIAL_PRODUCER</code> is set to <code>SEND_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST</code>, instead of fork/exec'ing the credential producer, it will send the job's blocking credential requests as a list of base64-encoded classads to the credd.
