I've attached a generated config.\n\n</p><p>I know you might be thinking, \"Who cares? They're line endings!\" Well let me tell you, when I see ^M in my vim window, I'm reminded that not all operating systems are created equally. That leads me to question what I'm doing with my life. What are any of us doing with our lives? It doesn't matter if we laugh or cry, live or die, or anything at all. Nothing matters. Nothing is all that we have left. Mirrors facing mirrors. In a universe racing towards heat death.\n\n</p><p>Thanks,\nMick</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-May-23 14:22", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Aug-21 10:57", "fixed_version": "2015-Aug-21 10:57", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "cjgreen", "rust": "28621", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
