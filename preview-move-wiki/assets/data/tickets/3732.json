These include dynamically generated things like NUM_CPUS and MEMORY, but also a bunch of Startd policy entries like PREEMPT, EVICT, SUSPEND and HOLD.\n\n<p>There are also knobs that don't appear to be in the code, including TOOLS_PROVIDE_OLD_MESSAGES and NETWORK_HORIZON.  The unit tests also param, and those params are in the table, including usefully named params like \"STRING\".</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jul-01 15:24", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jul-01 15:24", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-01 15:24", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
