We need the initial port number to be (a) different in different simultaneously-existing processes and (b) different from bind to bind within the same process.  Using a PRNG after seeding it with our PID should meet both requirements.  If get_random_uint() doesn't do that, we should understand why (and rewrite the port-choosing code to do that unless our understanding of why says we should do something else).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Mar-22 15:10", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Mar-22 15:10", "fixed_version": "2016-Mar-22 15:10", "broken_version": "v080405", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5555", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
