{"id": 2922, "title": "Ticket #2922: 64-bit guest OSes can't run in vmware for vm universe", "description": "<blockquote>\nOn some (and probably all) versions of VMWare, the default ethernet driver, vlance, doesn't work with 64-bit guest OSes. They require the alternate e1000 ethernet device, which can be specified in the .vmx file like so:\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">ethernet0.virtualDev = \"e1000\"\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>When the vm gahp munges the .vmx file before starting starting a vmware vm, it removes all lines starting with 'ethernet' and replaces them with settings that enforce the networking options given in the job ad. This will cause 64-bit OSes to fail to start.\n\n</p><p>As a quick fix for Condor 7.7.6, the vm gahp should keep 'ethernet0.virtualDev' settings in the .vmx file. For future consideration, the vm gahp has a white-list of .vmx settings to keep and strips out all others. We should rethink this setup, as other settings that should be kept are probably being dropped.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Apr-04 17:15</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=31517\">[31517]</a></span>: Fix running of 64-bit OSes under VMWare for vm universe. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=2922\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2922'); return false;\" title=\"64-bit guest OSes can't run in vmware for vm universe\">#2922</a></span> The vm gahp was stripping out lines like 'ethernet0.virtualDev = \"e1000\"' from the .vmx file.
