{"id": 2553, "title": "Ticket #2553: Expose SIGNAL_FAMILY via procd_ctl", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn OSG's usage of procd_ctl, we like to send slightly more polite signals to a job family (such as SIGTERM) before we SIGKILL it.\n\n<p>The implementation is currently race-prone, as we do a LIST + for loop of SIGNAL_PROCESS.\n\n</p><p>This could be solved if SIGNAL_FAMILY was directly exposed via procd_ctl.  I'd guess we'd also need a mechanism for querying the procd about what commands it supports.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2011-Oct-14 14:51", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Oct-14 14:51", "fixed_version": "2011-Oct-14 14:51", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "psilord", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dwd@fnal.gov", "due_date": ""}
