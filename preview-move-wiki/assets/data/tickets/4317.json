{"id": 4317, "title": "Ticket #4317: Improve DAGMan node status file test", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight now the job_dagman_node_status test only looks at the <strong>final</strong> node status file, and it should look at intermediate versions as well.  I'm in the process of working on this (on the V8_1-gittrac_4115-branch branch), but the test improvement may not be completed before the 8.1.6 release.  (The way this works is by having some of the node jobs copy the node status file to a different name, after making sure that the node status file has been re-generated <strong>after</strong> the node was submitted, so that there's not a race condition.)\n\n<p>Note:  I'm creating this derived ticket so that <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4115\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4115'); return false;\" title=\"Enhance DAGMan's node status file\">#4115</a></span> can be resolved when the code and documentation are complete, even if the test fix is not done.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Aug-07 13:29:05 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is basically a duplicate of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4252\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4252'); return false;\" title=\"DAGMan node status file test improvements\">#4252</a></span>, so I'm going to mark it as abandoned.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Aug-07 13:29", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2014-Apr-16 14:27", "fixed_version": "2014-Apr-16 14:27", "broken_version": "v080106", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "#4115", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
