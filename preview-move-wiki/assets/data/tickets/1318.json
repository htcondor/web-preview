{"id": 1318, "title": "Ticket #1318: Have DAGMan be a server or daemon", "description": "<blockquote>\nJust yimmed with Igor S about this -- he's interested in a scenario along the lines of having DAGMan be a daemon that would run multiple DAGs -- so he can run a lot of DAGs (independently) without having the overhead of a separate DAGMan for each one.  (And Miron has proposed this idea in the past, too.)  I think the idea is that you'd have a DAGMan daemon, kind of like the schedd, and condor_submit_dag would communicate with that daemon, instead of submitting a Condor job.\n\n<p>There's an awful lot to think about, though:\n* Just having multiple DAG objects inside DAGMan would take a lot of surgery.\n* Establishing a protocol for communicating with the daemon.\n* What happens when you want to condor_rm one DAG?\n* And I suspect that there are a ton of little gotchas waiting...\n\n</p><p>Anyhow, I told Igor that I'd make a ticket for this, but I really think it can't get worked on without a push from Miron, because it will be a <strong>big</strong> job.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Sep-21 12:02", "status": "defer", "created": "2010-Mar-30 17:13", "fixed_version": "2010-Mar-30 17:13", "broken_version": "v070501", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, psilord@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
