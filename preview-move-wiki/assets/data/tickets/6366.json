All of the lines appear to be incomplete entries that are missing a variable number of their initial characters.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Aug-08 11:55:32 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nWhen the schedd first opens the job_queue.log file (<code>LoadClassAdLog()</code>), it does not use O_APPEND. When the schedd opens a new file for truncation (<code>TruncateClassAdLog()</code>), it does use O_APPEND. If the file is \"clean\" when initially read in (i.e. no transactions and no incomplete entries), the schedd will use the non-append file descriptor for further writes. If the file isn't \"clean\", then it immediately does a truncation (resulting in a file descriptor in append mode).\n\n<p>The corruption we're seeing could be explained by a forked child process writing to the log file in non-append mode. Always opening the file in append mode would help prevent this, but we should also understand how the extra writes are happening.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Aug-10 12:55:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe log corruption appears to be caused by valgrind. I wrote a simple program that called fopen(), fprintf(), and _exit(). When I run it normally, the file is empty. When I run it under valgrind, the file contains the text from my fprintf().\n\n<p>The corruption always occurs around updates of <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LastRejMatchTime\" title=\"Last Rej Match Time\">LastRejMatchTime</a></span> and <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LastRejMatchReason\" title=\"Last Rej Match Reason\">LastRejMatchReason</a></span>, which are done non-durable, which means they aren't fflush()d. The corrupted job_queue.log was generated while the schedd was run under valgrind (while Greg investigated a crash).\nThroughout the file, groups of updates to <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LastRejMatchTime\" title=\"Last Rej Match Time\">LastRejMatchTime</a></span> and <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LastRejMatchReason\" title=\"Last Rej Match Reason\">LastRejMatchReason</a></span> are duplicated, sometimes jumping backward in time (duplicating entries from a second ago).\n\n</p><p>I believe whenever the schedd forked a child helper process when ad updates were buffered by stdio, valgrind caused those updates to be flushed when the child process exited.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2017-Dec-08 16:14", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2017-Aug-07 11:00", "fixed_version": "2017-Aug-07 11:00", "broken_version": "v080702", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
