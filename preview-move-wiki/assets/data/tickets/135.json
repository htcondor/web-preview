{"id": 135, "title": "Ticket #135: Make running  a subset of tests in NMI easy", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt should be easy to run just a subset of the tests in an NMI build.  This would speed up the development cycle if you're developing a new test, or working on a small subsection of code.  This is probably possible right now, but it's not obvious how.  Indeed, the fix may just be better documentation.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n--test-args=\"Imake class name\"\n\n<p>All tests can be in multiple classes. I keep one called btdebug and swap out which tests are assigned to it in the condor_tests Imakefile. Pete has busted up some of the others... into different classes.\n\n</p><p>However running concurrently I can run the entire gaunlet in about 45 minutes\nand there is something to be said for a complete sweep of the tests.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 14:26", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-28 11:43", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-28 11:43", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
