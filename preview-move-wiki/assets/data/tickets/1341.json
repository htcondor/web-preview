{"id": 1341, "title": "Ticket #1341: Rename \"user log\" to \"event log\" or possible \"job event log\"", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe per-job log file is commonly called the \"user log\". This name goes all the way into the code, where the job's <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> points to the file with the name <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=UserLog\" title=\"User Log\">UserLog</a></span>.  However, it's confusing, as it's not a log of the user, it's a log of the job's events.  Tellingly, the configuration setting to create a global user log file is EVENT_LOG, not USER_LOG.  Calling it instead the \"event log\" or even more specifically the \"job event log\" would be much clearer.\n\n<p>This will involve changes in the code to fix user visible usages (including <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=UserLog\" title=\"User Log\">UserLog</a></span>), the documentation, and our daily language.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:01:00 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:01", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Apr-12 14:55", "fixed_version": "2010-Apr-12 14:55", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
