{"id": 109, "title": "Ticket #109: \"ProcD has failed\" messages appear in daemon logs when machines halt", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs part of the normal Linux shutdown procedure, shortly before powering down, all processes are sent a SIGTERM. If Condor is still running (perhaps because a job is taking a long time to checkpoint), the ProcD will exit since it has no special handling for SIGTERM. The daemon that started the ProcD is then notified via its reaper, and responds with an EXCEPT. This results in \"ProcD has failed\" messages in daemon logs, and also can cause false alarm obituaries to be sent out.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Mar-30 13:50", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-26 09:54", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-26 09:54", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
