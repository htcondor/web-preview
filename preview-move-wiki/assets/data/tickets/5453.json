{"id": 5453, "title": "Ticket #5453: HTCondor View: constant date_end-date_start but changing graph range", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf date_start/date_end are specified, we limit the data to that graph, then graph it. However, unless we happen to have data right at those ends, the actual graph will expand to show the actual range of data. This is surprising: it doesn't seem like it's showing what you asked for. Also, if you are refreshing the graph regularly, it means that the exact duration shown will not quite be constant. Worst case, if you have a gap, it will suddenly jump!\n\n<p>The ideal solution is to capture one more set of samples on either side of the requested range, then limit the graph to the exact range. The extra samples ensures we have data running all the way up to the end of the range. This is a Very Hard problem, it's hard to even specify. Samples may not be arriving simultaneously; identifying all of the samples you need to ensure all lines continue may be very tricky. There is certainly no way to specify this now.\n\n</p><p>As a possibility, we could just set the graph to the exact range. However, this almost guarantees that there will be gaps on either side, which looks like missing data (which is sort of is).\n\n</p><p>I don't have any good answers here. Perhaps we just live with the graph not quite matching expectations.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Dec-23 14:06", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Dec-23 14:06", "fixed_version": "2015-Dec-23 14:06", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5351", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
