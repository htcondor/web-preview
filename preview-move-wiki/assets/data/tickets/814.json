{"id": 814, "title": "Ticket #814: configure: Allow --enable-proper with --with-xxx-external", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor building Condor on non-CSL supported machines, it'd be very useful to be able to invoke configure in such a way that it'd use \"proper\" versions of things that the O/S provides, but build external versions of those that it doesn't.  In porting to the SuSE platforms on NMI, I've found, in particular, that PCRE isn't installed, and it'd be very useful to combine proper and externals in a useful way.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Oct-05 11:50:36 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nAnother example: classads\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-05 12:29:43 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nWhat if building externals is a separate step in the build process? You run \"build externals\" and then \"configure --with-&lt;ext&gt;=&lt;location&gt;\"? Or even \"build externals\" could build all the externals it can and then CFLAGS/LDFLAGS can be passed to configure.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 06:12", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Oct-05 11:26", "fixed_version": "2009-Oct-05 11:26", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "nleroy", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
