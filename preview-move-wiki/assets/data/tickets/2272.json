{"id": 2272, "title": "Ticket #2272: Need command-line tool condor_checkpoint_job", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe condor_checkpoint command needs a companion condor_checkpoint_job, similar to condor_vacate_job. Condor_checkpoint connects to a startd and tells it to checkpoint one of its running jobs. In a pool with strong security enabled, a user will typically not have the necessary authorization to issue this command (the startd will reject it). Condor_checkpoint_job would connect to the schedd and tell it to checkpoint one or more of the user's running jobs.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Jun-27 11:43", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Jun-27 11:43", "fixed_version": "2011-Jun-27 11:43", "broken_version": "v070500", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
