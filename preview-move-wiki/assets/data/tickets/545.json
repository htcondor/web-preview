No need for a hawkeye plugin, this could be \"built in\" (since it already is).\n\n</p><p>Thoughts?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-16 16:35:02 by burnett:</em> <br/>\n\nHow far do we want to take this?  It would be tryvial to get the available memory, but would it be an idea to allow users to select all the values they'd like put into the machine ad?  For instance, users may be interesting in VMware's statistics, or the number or process running on the machine, etc.  Just an idea.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Feb-03 08:14", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jun-06 10:58", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-06 10:58", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
