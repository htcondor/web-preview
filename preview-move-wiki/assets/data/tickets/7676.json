{"id": 7676, "title": "Ticket #7676: Add config.d directory for packagers", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn HTCondor-CE, we have two different config.d directories: /etc/condor-ce/config.d and /usr/share/condor-ce/config.d/. The former includes minimal config files with clear examples of commonly changed values and is used as the interface for admins to customize their own installation. The latter, OTOH, is used by packagers to drop in default configuration, which is particularly useful for default configuration required by optional packages.\n\n<p>We'd like the \"packager config.d\" added to HTCondor for downstream packagers (OSG) and packages like GlideinWMS and scitokens-credmon.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Nov-02 14:20:38 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nMoved to Jira: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-45\">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-45</a></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-02 14:20", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2020-Jun-09 08:57", "fixed_version": "2020-Jun-09 08:57", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "blin", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "blin@cs.wisc.edu, jpatton@cs.wisc.edu, bbockelman@morgridge.org", "due_date": ""}
