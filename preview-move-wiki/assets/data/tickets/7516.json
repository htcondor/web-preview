This seems stupid, and made worse by not checking to see if the putative plug-in is available.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Feb-21 16:09:43 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThere's another problem where uploading to the wrong region will not be reported as a failure but of course doesn't succeed.

(On the other hand, once we get to trying to download the pre-signed URLs, we shouldn't be seeing the plug-in message any more, so maybe there should be a child ticket for properly reporting problems that happen with downloads?)\n\n<p>(I'll let Mark work on those issues, since he knows the curl plugin.)</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Feb-27 15:37</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/ea95c7a11e3a52b50fb23404c1cf031a90030e57\">[59061]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"active\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7516\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7516'); return false;\" title=\"S3 file transfer needs accurate error messaging\">#7516</a></span>) Properly report problems from generate_presigned_url().
