{"id": 1903, "title": "Ticket #1903: Temporarily larger JobLeaseDuration", "description": "<blockquote>\n<span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobLeaseDuration\" title=\"Job Lease Duration\">JobLeaseDuration</a></span> defaults to 20 minutes, which is a reasonable default for brief, unexpected outages.  But it's not long enough for a longer outage, especially a planned one.  \"We're doing a major rewiring, and the network will be down for the day,\" or \"We're doing a major hardware upgrade on the submit machine\" type outages.  A administrator could benefit from the ability to say, \"Temporarily extend all <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobLeaseDurations\" title=\"Job Lease Durations\">JobLeaseDurations</a></span> to X hours from now.\"  At now + X, the old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobLeaseDurations\" title=\"Job Lease Durations\">JobLeaseDurations</a></span> reassert themselves.  Notably, running jobs would also need to respect the updated duration, something not currently done, (see ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1904\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1904'); return false;\" title=\"qedit JobLeaseDuration doesn't work on running jobs.\">#1904</a></span>).\n\n<p>Strawman proposal: add <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobLeaseNoEarlierThan\" title=\"Job Lease No Earlier Than\">JobLeaseNoEarlierThan</a></span>, which is a timestamp (set to now +X).
