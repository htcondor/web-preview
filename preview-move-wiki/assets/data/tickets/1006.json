The condor_collector might not be running, it might\nbe refusing to communicate with you, there might be a network problem, or\nthere may be some other problem. Check with your system administrator to fix\nthis problem.\n\nIf you are the system administrator, check that the condor_collector is\nrunning on &lt;10.16.44.233:37933&gt;, check the HOSTALLOW configuration in your\ncondor_config, and check the MasterLog and CollectorLog files in your log\ndirectory for possible clues as to why the condor_collector is not\nresponding. Also see the Troubleshooting section of the manual.\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n3rd patch looks good.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/144/patch_for_tkt_1006.patch\">patch_for_tkt_1006.patch</a>\n5015 bytes added by eje on 2010-Mar-03 21:24:35 UTC.\n<br/>\npatch submitted to resolve bug<br/>\n</li><li><a href=\"../files/145/patch2_for_tkt_1006.patch\">patch2_for_tkt_1006.patch</a>\n5603 bytes added by eje on 2010-Mar-04 05:09:19 UTC.\n<br/>\nsecond candidate patch for resolving bug.\nreplaces previous: patch_for_tkt_1006.patch\n<br/>\n</li><li><a href=\"../files/146/patch3_for_tkt_1006.patch\">patch3_for_tkt_1006.patch</a>\n5497 bytes added by eje on 2010-Mar-04 16:50:03 UTC.\n<br/>\nthird candidate.  reverts to always outputting err-code and err-stack.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Mar-16 14:20</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/527bcb4977e00f445c0762afe43551f2de5426e9\">[17640]</a></span>: corrections and improvements to error messages relating to failure to locate or contact daemons <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1006\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1006'); return false;\" title=\"condor_status -direct to stale ad reports confusing error\">#1006</a></span> Committer: Robert Rati  (By Erik Erlandson )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Mar-22 11:44", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Nov-30 11:04", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-30 11:04", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "eje", "derived_from": "", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu, rrati@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
