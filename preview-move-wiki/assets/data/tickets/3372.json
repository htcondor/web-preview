{"id": 3372, "title": "Ticket #3372: Remove \"-disable\" option from condor_submit documentation", "description": "<blockquote>\nI think the \"-disable\" option to condor_submit is very confusing.\n\n<p>Can we rename this to \"-disable-file-checks\" in the documentation?  The code appears to just look for the \"-disable\" prefix, so renaming it in the documentation shouldn't hurt.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Apr-01 11:54:01 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nSorry, but the documentation is correct in this case, so adding something to the documentation (that is not implemented in the code) would be misleading.  You already know that you can add more to your own command-line argument.\n\n<p>If you want the code changed, then please make this ticket one for code enhancement.  No one will pay attention to the ticket as a 'doc' ticket.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2014-Aug-04 12:28", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2012-Dec-12 08:01", "fixed_version": "2012-Dec-12 08:01", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
