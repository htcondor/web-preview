{"id": 4965, "title": "Ticket #4965: Master not shuting down all daemons in two case", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis will be testing with manual operations. Moving on to codnor_submit foreach\ntesting.\n\n<p>We have two tests which are unrelated to each other seemingly. However they both\ncan be run on a desktop to see the strange behaviour. The tests are job_filexfer_minus1_van.run and job_dagman_job_held.run. They now start their own personal condor allowing the check for all the daemons being down. When condor_off -master is seen by the master, it says it is exiting and does tell the startd to shutdown. None of the other daemons get terminated notification and the master does go away.\n\n</p><p>I will be extracting manual steps for replication. Running both tests with\nleaking code enabled in CondorTest::EndTest will see leaking daemons every time.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nThis could not be duplicated outside the test environment.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2015-Apr-02 14:34", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2015-Mar-31 14:07", "fixed_version": "2015-Mar-31 14:07", "broken_version": "v080305", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonMaster", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
