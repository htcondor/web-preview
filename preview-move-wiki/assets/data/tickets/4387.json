But the output ends like this:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">  12:44:44 Test: executed unsuccessfully\n  failure unexpected\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and the test still shows up as green.  I don't know what the hell is going on with that. I really don't know what's going on with this one, and whether it ever worked right.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-May-29 14:14", "status": "new", "created": "2014-May-29 11:47", "fixed_version": "2014-May-29 11:47", "broken_version": "v080300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
