{"id": 1989, "title": "Ticket #1989: APPEND_REQUIREMENTS should be done by condor_schedd, not submitter", "description": "<blockquote>\nAPPEND_REQUIREMENTS is currently used by condor_submit; I claim that this really should be moved to the condor_schedd.  Why?  If a user is submitting directly to the schedd (either via condor_submit, SOAP, or Condor-C), they likely have no clue what the APPEND_REQUIREMENTS the pool needs.\n\n<p>Where else would this be useful?  If I setup a Condor-C gateway to our site that uses the condor_job_router to transform incoming jobs (maybe I convert an incoming vanilla job to a PBS job?), I want to prevent jobs from starting until the router has been given a chance to transform it.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3458\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3458'); return false;\" title=\"APPEND_REQUIREMENTS should not apply to scheduler universe?\">#3458</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nAPPEND_REQUIREMENTS should not apply to scheduler universe?</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 12:41", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Mar-21 14:01", "fixed_version": "2011-Mar-21 14:01", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
