{"id": 2243, "title": "Ticket #2243: NETWORK_INTERFACE and HAD not compatible", "description": "<blockquote>\nreport from customer:\n\n<p>Although the parameter NETWORK_INTERFACE being set in the configuration file, some communications between the daemons are tryed to be performed through the other NIC that exists on a machine. HAD is enabled between collector1 and collector2. This was observed when one of the collectors tries to communicate with the other one. This occurs when we set COLLECTOR_HOST = collector1.domain,collector2.domain. The avoidance is to set COLLECTOR_HOST to the corresponding IP addresses of the collectors, that is not good in case the IP addresses need to be changed in the DNS (the system admin needs to also update Condor settings to reflect the change).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2011-Jun-15 14:26", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Jun-15 14:26", "fixed_version": "2011-Jun-15 14:26", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "support", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
