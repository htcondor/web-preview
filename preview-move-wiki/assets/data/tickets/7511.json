This would make it possible to contact a daemon's sibling by changing the subsys/local name portion of the shared port ID.\n\n<p>Possibly depending on the host OS, it may also be possible to remove the arbitrary integer suffix as well, which would make the major shared port socket IDs more compact.  (Major meaning, \"those started directly by the master.\"  Other shared port listeners may not have unique base socket IDs; starters, for instance, certainly don't, and sockets created by tools probably don't.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Feb-26 10:23:05 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nTJ agrees that this doesn't need any documentation (and that in fact we don't want to <em>document</em>, in the sense of \"make promises about\" anything about the shared port ID).\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:46:37 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080906 to v080907 using ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Feb-25 13:38</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/803052f32aaa9b52aac170a54335245902a30ef7\">[59032]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7511\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7511'); return false;\" title=\"Master-started daemons' socket names don't need a sequence number\">#7511</a></span>) Remove sequence number from shared port ID of daemons started by the master.
