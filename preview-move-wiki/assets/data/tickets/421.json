This leads to unnecessary system load and eventual build and test failures.  The machine involved is nmi-0047. Please make Condor to clean up after itself on this platform.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jul-12 15:11:43 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nbgietzel reports that the BATLab is pretty much keeping HPUX alive for us. We dropped HPUX support at the end of 7.4. The only reason it may come up is if we ever need to issue a security fix for 7.4 and this bug makes it harder.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Jul-12 15:11", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-27 12:27", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-27 12:27", "broken_version": "v070104", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bgietzel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
