{"id": 3575, "title": "Ticket #3575: make it easier to get condor_gather_info output to the condor team", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe new condor_gather_info is great!  I owe Greg a beer or three for improving it, and unwittingly subjecting himself to a lifetime of feature requests and scope creep. ;)\n\n<p>In all seriousness, however, the last important obstacle to solving the original problem (users finding it unclear and time-consuming to submit the necessary info to the Condor team to debug their problems) is that the giant tarfile is impossible to send to the Condor team via email, RUST, etc.  It's often 100's of MB.\n\n</p><p>We need some kind of automatic (or at least easy) data upload solution (like many other crash-debug systems have these days).\n\n</p><p>I'm not sure what the exact solution should be, but we should figure something out.  I'm happy to help make it happen.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nWe should give some thought to any privacy and/or security issues this raises.  It might be adequate to do something as simple as print a warning (with confirmation) prior to upload that this will expose internal system information to Condor including the names of users and processes.  I.e., punt to the user.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Sep-21 11:40", "status": "defer", "created": "2013-Apr-16 15:17", "fixed_version": "2013-Apr-16 15:17", "broken_version": "v070906", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "#3246", "creator": "pfc", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pfcouvar@syr.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
