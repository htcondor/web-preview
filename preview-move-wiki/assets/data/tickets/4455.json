For example, node 0 might set up a server for other nodes to connect to, and need to transmit a dynamically created security key.  While you could bake a hard coded key in, a dynamic key ensures that someone who gains read access to the executable can't connect to the running server.\n\n<p>To aid in this, it would be nice for chirp to be able to read and set private attributes in the job ad.
