{"id": 5531, "title": "Ticket #5531: Unifiy submit files for docker and vanilla universe", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, the semantics of the job executable for docker and vanilla universe are a bit different.  In vanilla universe, if the executable is transferred to the scratch directory we notice that, and prepend the scratch directory to the basename of the command.  In docker universe, we just try to run the command verbatim.\n\n<p>This makes it difficult to switch between docker and vanilla universe by just changing the condor universe.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Feb-26 15:02:44 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThe user also specifically noted that Docker requires that the executable be specifically listed in transfer_input_files.  If that's true (as opposed to being a consequence of the path issue detailed above), we should fix it.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Feb-26 15:02", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Feb-25 14:05", "fixed_version": "2016-Feb-25 14:05", "broken_version": "v080500", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
