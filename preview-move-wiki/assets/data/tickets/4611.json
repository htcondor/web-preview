{"id": 4611, "title": "Ticket #4611: Resource request count metrics", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe noticed today on the CMS / HTCondor phone call that we have been using auto-clusters as a proxy for negotiating times.\n\n<p>However, this is not necessarily true - we really need a count of the resource request clusters; that's what is sent to the negotiator.  There may be several of these per auto-cluster.\n\n</p><p>To some extent, we are running blind - we have no clue how many RRC's there are per auto-cluster.  We'd like to get the statistic reported before we ask for any changes in the negotiation algorithm.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Mar-19 15:53:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nWe are going to start with a statistic of <code>ResourceRequestsSent</code>, which will be a schedd statistic of the total number (since schedd start) and the recent number (aka past 20 minutes) of resource requests sent to the negotiator.\n\n<p>Future steps could be to publish statistics about the number of resource requests embodied by all the jobs in the queue, and/or to perhaps break the statistics down per user.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Mar-20 14:28</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=43646\">[43646]</a></span>: add <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ResourceRequestsSent\" title=\"Resource Requests Sent\">ResourceRequestsSent</a></span> statistic to schedd. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=4611\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4611'); return false;\" title=\"Resource request count metrics\">#4611</a></span> ===VersionHistory:Pending===  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Apr-16 20:24", "status": "resolved", "created": "2014-Sep-25 08:10", "fixed_version": "2014-Sep-25 08:10", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#4490", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
