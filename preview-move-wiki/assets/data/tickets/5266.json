This works just fine for version 8.2.9 (condor-8.2.9-335839.x86_64) and so I downgraded HTCondor back to that version so that we could continue running.\n\n</p><p>A submission under version 8.4.0 produced:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>ERROR: Failed to connect to local queue manager\nAUTHENTICATE:1003:Failed to authenticate with any method\nAUTHENTICATE:1004:Failed to authenticate using FS\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Sep-23 16:18:37 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nThe problem was unreproducible.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2015-Sep-23 16:20", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2015-Sep-21 11:54", "fixed_version": "2015-Sep-21 11:54", "broken_version": "v080400", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tim", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
