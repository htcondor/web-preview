{"id": 5181, "title": "Ticket #5181: JobRouter thinks Condor-CE job is sandbox when it adopts orphan", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt appears that, when adopting orphan jobs (i.e., reconnecting to jobs after the process is restarted), the job router will assume jobs with SUBMIT_Iwd are sandboxed.\n\n<p>However, this doesn't appear to be a safe assumption.  I don't understand all the remapping rules, but it seems this is very common for remotely-submitted vanilla jobs (i.e., how HTCondor-CE works).\n\n</p><p>A better approach would be to add a \"<span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=IsSandboxed\" title=\"Is Sandboxed\">IsSandboxed</a></span>\" attribute to the routed job and look for that when reconnecting.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jul-29 08:51:06 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nTo test:\n<ul>\n<li>Submit a job remotely to a HTCondor-CE.\n</li><li>Wait for the job to be routed.\n</li><li>SIGTERM the job router process.\n</li><li>Wait for the job to be re-adopted by the job router and run to completion.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Without this patch, the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobRouter\" title=\"Job Router\">JobRouter</a></span> will attempt to transfer a sandbox after completion and error out.
