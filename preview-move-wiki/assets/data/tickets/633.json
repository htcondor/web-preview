It then waits for the evict event.  After the evict event, it sleeps, then checks to see if the xfer'd files are in the spool area.\n\n<p>When the test fails, the job starts up running again between the successful vacate and the check for the spooled files.\n\n</p><p>I'll fix this by putting a requirement in the job that it only start once.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Jul-18 16:22</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/b91a040c500c808ae3110805af870fb020b5588a\">[15140]</a></span>: Insure that the test job doesn't restart after vacate <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=633\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('633'); return false;\" title=\"job_filexfer_output-withvacate_van intermittent failure\">#633</a></span>  (By Greg Thain )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2009-Dec-26 20:26", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jul-17 12:00", "fixed_version": "2009-Jul-17 12:00", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "bt", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
