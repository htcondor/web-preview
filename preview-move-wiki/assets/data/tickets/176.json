I hate opening Windows source random *nix new-lines and I quite positive you all hate the reverse.  The above page seems to offer a pretty good fix to the whole thing, without requiring much thought on anyone's part.\n\n</p><p>As an alternative, it would be great to simply have all the source code have *inx new-lines.  This way Emacs wouldn't have random ^M characters everywhere and Visual Studio would not ask me each time if I'd like to normalize a file to Windows or *inx new-lines.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Feb-02 09:33", "fixed_version": "2009-Feb-02 09:33", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "burnett", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
