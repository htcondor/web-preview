{"id": 3143, "title": "Ticket #3143: A few missing dep checks for UW builds", "description": "<blockquote>\nI tried doing a UW build on a fresh, minimal Fedora box, and found the cmake dependency checks have a few holes in them for externals:\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li><div class=\"strike\">\n<strike>The box didn't have wget installed; this was not tested, so obviously all externals failed.  Cmake should have tested for this case.</strike></div>\n\n</li><li><div class=\"strike\">\n<strike>gsoap requires bison-devel to be installed so liby is present.  cmake did not test for this.</strike></div>\n\n</li><li><div class=\"strike\">\n<strike>For deltacloud, I needed to also install libpam and libxml2.  cmake did not test for this.</strike></div>\n\n</li><li><div class=\"strike\">\n<strike>Globus wouldn't build without perl-Archive-Tar.  cmake did not test for this.</strike></div>\n\n</li><li>At \"make -j5\", the gt2_gahp failed to build due to missing Globus headers - globus external was being installed in parallel.  I think there might be a missing dependency between the two.\n</li><li><div class=\"strike\">\n<strike>blahp requires libtoolize</strike></div>\n\n</li><li><div class=\"strike\">\n<strike>deltacloud_gahp requires libxml2 to build successfully, but cmake does not require this.

I killed the build process in the middle of making the gsoap external. When I restarted it, cmake skipped the patch step and went straight to the make step. Perhaps you got very unlucky and your build died in the middle of applying the patches to the gsoap source.\n\n<p>Even if this situation is rare, adding -N to the patch calls would improve things.\n</p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-05 10:58:27 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070904 to v070905 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-22 11:10:10 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070905 to v070906 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/668/condor_gt3143.patch\">condor_gt3143.patch</a>\n24860 bytes added by bbockelm on 2013-Jan-04 13:51:40 UTC.\n<br/>\nAllow patch commands to be re-run.
