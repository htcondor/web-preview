{"id": 4786, "title": "Ticket #4786: Crondor didn't restart problem jobs on submit-4", "description": "<blockquote>\nOn December 12, 2014, the filesystems on submit-4.chtc.wisc.edu were rebuilt. When the machine was restarted, the Condor spool directory and job queue were restored, but the directories for SOAR were missing. The schedd tried and failed to run the SOAR cron jobs, and put the jobs on hold. When the SOAR directories were later restored, the jobs were released. But the schedd never tried to run them again. A reschedule and a reconfig made no difference. Only restarting the schedd caused it to start running the jobs again.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2014-Dec-17 09:29", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Dec-17 09:29", "fixed_version": "2014-Dec-17 09:29", "broken_version": "v080301", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bt@cs.wisc.edu,jfrey@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
