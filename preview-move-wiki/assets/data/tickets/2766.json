{"id": 2766, "title": "Ticket #2766: Warn of restart-only config changes on reconfig", "description": "<blockquote>\nCondor daemons should be aware of configuration settings where changes are ignored on a reconfig.  If one of those settings changes, the daemon should note it and emit a warning that the change is being ignored to the log.\n\n<p>The daemon should always compare against the value seen at start up.  That way if a confused admin runs condor_reconfig repeatedly, the warning will keep popping up.\n\n</p><p>Proposed message:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">09/26/11 13:56:19 Warning: Ignoring change of NUM_SLOTS from \"2\" to \"4\".
