{"id": 5397, "title": "Ticket #5397: Create a \"throttling\" section in the DAGMan manual", "description": "<blockquote>\nI'm currently working on <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=5332\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5332'); return false;\" title=\"Address doc confusion for DAGMan maxjobs and maxidle\">#5332</a></span> (Address doc confusion for DAGMan maxjobs and maxidle) and I'm trying to quickly get something better in place for the 8.4.2 release.  But I'm thinking now that what we really should do for this is to create a \"throttling\" section in the DAGMan part of the manual that explains in one place how this all works, and then have links to that section from the appropriate places in the configuration page and the condor_dagman and condor_submit_dag man pages.\n\n<p>I'm thinking that this new section should cover maxidle, maxjobs, maxpre, maxpost, and maybe the node category throttles.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2015-Nov-13 14:16", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Nov-13 14:16", "fixed_version": "2015-Nov-13 14:16", "broken_version": "v080401", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5332", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, lmichael@wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
