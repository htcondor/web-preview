{"id": 1446, "title": "Ticket #1446: Schedd needs D_ALWAYS about new jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nGiven that queuing new jobs is a core part of the schedd's purpose, it's surprising that there isn't a D_ALWAYS in which it acknowledges that it has queued new jobs.  This can complicate debugging.  The schedd should do so.\n\n<p>There is a risk of flooding the log of a busy queue.  Perhaps it's not a problem: if you're submitting 100,000 jobs in quick succession, maybe 100,000 log entries isn't really that big of a deal.  If the largest jobs tend to be clusters, perhaps the schedd could collect them in a single log message (\"Accepted jobs 98.0-98.100000\").  The schedd could also group all new jobs within a single minute (\"Accepted jobs 98-99, 200000 total clusters.\").</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:08:44 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:09", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Jun-11 12:16", "fixed_version": "2010-Jun-11 12:16", "broken_version": "v070204", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
