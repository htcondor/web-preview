There is no information about previous factors and when they were changed.  Were the information stored in a configuration file, you could use standard revision control systems, or even just comments, but neither is a practical option here.\n</li><li>Similarly, there is no good place to log why a given priority was issued.  Again, in a configuration file you you could use comments, but that's not an option.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-May-16 17:20", "status": "new", "created": "2012-May-16 17:19", "fixed_version": "2012-May-16 17:19", "broken_version": "v060000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
