{"id": 4376, "title": "Ticket #4376: VM Universe should advertise when the user job decided it has started.", "description": "<blockquote>\nOne common problem for users of the virtual machine universe is that their VMs fail to boot or otherwise fail to start the user's application.  This is particularly troublesome because this kind of badput can be hard to detect.  We should therefore provide a facility with which a user can notify HTCondor that their application has, in fact, started.  Once notified, HTCondor should advertise that fact, both for informative purposes and for possible use in policy decisions.  (E.g., if my job doesn't start in twenty minutes, it's not going to, please try it again somewhere else.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-May-27 14:19", "status": "new", "created": "2014-May-27 14:19", "fixed_version": "2014-May-27 14:19", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "VM", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
