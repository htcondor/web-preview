{"id": 1503, "title": "Ticket #1503: SOAP useless D_ALWAYS level", "description": "<blockquote>\nin \"int DaemonCore::HandleReq(Stream <strong>insock, Stream</strong> asock)\" (condor_daemon_core.V6/daemon_core.cpp around line 4112), the SOAP code path logs several messages at D_ALWAYS.  The generated lines look like thiS:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">07/14 14:02:57 About to serve HTTP request...\n07/14 14:02:57 Completed servicing HTTP request\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>That seems of limited value, especially at the D_ALWAYS level.  We don't normally log \"normal\" condor commands.  A user making heavy use of the SOAP interface will find his log filling much more quickly than another user doing the same operations with condor_q/condor_submit/etc.  Perhaps it should be downgraded to D_DAEMONCORE or D_FULLDEBUG?\n\n</p><p>As an added bonus it would be nice if the command was included in those lines (getVersionString, submit, etc)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:08:44 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-May-26 20:01:57 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe SOAP code is dead.
