I think it would be useful to have a command (condor_hold_dag?) that would hold a DAGMan job <strong>and</strong> all of its node jobs; <strong>and</strong> do the same thing for any number of levels of sub-DAGs.\n\n<p>It's pretty simple to run a command to hold all of node jobs for a single-level DAG, but if you have sub-DAGs it gets trickier -- it would probably be useful to encapsulate this into a single command.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Aug-22 13:03", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Aug-21 11:27", "fixed_version": "2013-Aug-21 11:27", "broken_version": "v080101", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu,vahi@isi.edu", "due_date": ""}
