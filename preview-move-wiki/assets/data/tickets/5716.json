{"id": 5716, "title": "Ticket #5716: if NEG_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION=false, ignore exhausted partitionable slot", "description": "<blockquote>\nCMS runs a very large pool with NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION=false, and an increasing percentage of partitionable slots.  In the steady-state cause, most of the partitionable slots will have exhausted their resources -- out of CPUs, Memory, or other attributes; having given them out to their child dynamic slots.  These partitionable slots won't ever match anything, in the same way that Claimed slots can't match anything.  However, unlike Claimed slots, the NEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION code doesn't remove them from future matching consideration.\n\n<p>In the case with a full pool in steady state, the majority of Unclaimed slots might be these exhausted partitionable slots.  We should add code to trim out these slots, to improve negotiator performance.\n\n</p><p>We could test the impact of this by adding a (Cpus &gt; 0) clause to NEGOTIATOR_SLOT_CONSTRAINT.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jun-08 11:31", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jun-08 10:12", "fixed_version": "2016-Jun-08 10:12", "broken_version": "v080500", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
