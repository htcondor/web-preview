(It correctly reports the log monitoring error, but also reports a cycle.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Oct-14 11:24:16 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm going to resolve this ticket, because it's a duplicate of 832, which has more details.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-19 12:09:49 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nSee <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=832\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('832'); return false;\" title=\"DAGMan erroneously reports cycle when user log unreadable\">#832</a></span>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-13 16:09:53 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nResolving this because the problem is fixed, and <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=832\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('832'); return false;\" title=\"DAGMan erroneously reports cycle when user log unreadable\">#832</a></span> is resolved.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Jan-21 07:30", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Aug-14 16:25", "fixed_version": "2009-Aug-14 16:25", "broken_version": "v070302", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
