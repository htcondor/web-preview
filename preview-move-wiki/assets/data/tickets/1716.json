I think we can survive with &lt; 20 Meg paths for a good long time.... :)\n\n</p><p>This bug was found by our unit tests.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Oct-14 16:26:59 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThere were some mines in a minefield while checking in the change, so I had to\nend up cherry picking it from master into V7_4-branch.
