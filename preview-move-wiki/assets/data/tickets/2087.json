But the \"Priorities and Preemption\" section of the manual (<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.6/2_7Priorities_Preemption.html#SECTION00371000000000000000\">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.6/2_7Priorities_Preemption.html#SECTION00371000000000000000</a>) says higher is <strong>better</strong>.  And the \"Changing the priority of jobs\" section (<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.6/2_6Managing_Job.html#sec:job-prio\">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.6/2_6Managing_Job.html#sec:job-prio</a>) doesn't say anything about which way is \"better\".
