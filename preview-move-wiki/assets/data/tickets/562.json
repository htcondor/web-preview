Failing that, detecting the problem and providing a more useful error message would be nice.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 17:11", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jun-15 14:23", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-15 14:23", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
