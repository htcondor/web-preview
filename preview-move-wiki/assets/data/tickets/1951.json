For v7.6.0 and beyond, obviously it should be built and packaged.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Mar-07 13:52:01 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nPreviously I had prebuilt, called it mail and put it in msconfig, b/c of issues with cmake and .net projects(http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=9742&amp;nbn=4).  Another option would be to call out devenv on the project itself.\n\n<p>Or 3rd option, to convert it to native using the twelve million examples that exist.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-08 14:06:28 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nResorted to just prebuilding the thing.  Tested in 7_6-branch.  Though there are other implications of having a .NET application and not really declaring that fact while in the installer.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-30 15:15:26 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nThis can likely be closed out now.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Mar-08 13:53</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=20983\">[20983]</a></span>: Add condor_mail.exe as a binary blob since it is highly unlikely to ever see any changes unless we end up rewriting it as a native application.
