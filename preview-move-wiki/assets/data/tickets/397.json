In the HTML versions of our manual generated by latex2html, these are passed through unchanged, and it looks wrong.  In a perfect world, they would be rendered as \"smart quotes\" (thats &amp;ldquo; and &amp;rdquo;), but even straight quotes \"like this\" would be an improvement.  (I'd give an example of smart quotes, but <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GitTrac\" title=\"Git Trac\">GitTrac</a></span> doesn't like them.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Nov-01 13:16:31 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nNo longer using LaTeX</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Nov-01 13:16", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Apr-20 15:46", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-20 15:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
