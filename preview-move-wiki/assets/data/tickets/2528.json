{"id": 2528, "title": "Ticket #2528: startd hard-killing of starter is harmfull when using glexec", "description": "<blockquote>\nDuring a fast shutdown, the startd expects the starter to go away within KILLING_TIMEOUT seconds (default 30).  If it does not, the startd hard-kills the starter and all of its children.\n\n<p>Since the startd is naive about glexec, this will likely leave behind job processes and directories.  As a workaround, one could set KILLING_TIMEOUT to be very long.  However, it would be nice if Condor handled this case better by default.\n\n</p><p>Here is a specific case of this problem reported by Igor:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>10/01/11 08:07:10 (pid:28190) attempt to connect to &lt;169.228.130.26:9615&gt; failed: Connection timed out (connect errno = 110).

The logic is complicated enough that I can't answer that question without more investigation.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Oct-05 15:59:23 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI tested whether job processes get left behind when the startd hard-kills the starter.  The answer is no in my tests.  Both the starter and the startd rely on the procd to kill the job.  The procd uses glexec to kill the processes.\n\n<p>The job execute directory does get left behind.  Neither the startd nor preen can clean it up, because it belongs to a different user.  It may be common that condor is running as a glidein under some other batch system that will clean up the execute directories once the glidein exits.  When this is true, the leaked directories are probably not a major concern.  When it is not true, this could be a big problem.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Oct-05 17:03:54 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBurt expressed his concerns that leaked directories could lead to workernode disks filling up during the lifetime of the glidein.  Therefore, this issue is a concern to glideinWMS, even in the case where the underlying batch system cleans up after the glidein exits.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Jan-30 14:56", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Oct-05 11:49", "fixed_version": "2011-Oct-05 11:49", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#2753", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "isfiligoi@ucsd.edu,dan@hep.wisc.edu,burt@fnal.gov,zmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
