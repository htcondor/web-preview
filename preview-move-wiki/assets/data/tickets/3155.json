No custom jigging to run a subset or suite.\n</li><li>The tests shall able to be run in parallel.\n</li><li>A timeout for the runtime of a test should be able to be specified/enforced, such that hung/run-away tests get cleaned up and marked as failed.\n</li><li>support for re-usable fixtures - especially, but not necessarily limited to, condor configurations as fixtures.  Taking boost::test as a model, the ability to apply fixtures at the suite level and the individual test level would be useful (and efficient).\n</li><li>should provide a set of API routines that allow a given test to wait for various pool states before proceeding, for example wait_for_slots(n), wait_for_daemons(daemon-name-list), wait_for_job_{submitted,running,completed}(job-spec(s)), wait_for_next_negotiation_cycle(), etc\n</li><li>should control condor daemons as an external user would do; for example, no direct startup of daemons, but invocation of appropriate system script (service condor start; net start condor, etc); or control of the queue using condor_q/condor_history; no \"insider\" tricks.\n</li><li>easy access/analysis of logs: this could be done also indirectly, cleaning up/standardizing the format of the logs (rfc5424?)\n</li><li>should support long-term load/stress testing (for instance by repeating individual [unit-]tests).\n</li><li>should support both stop-on-error and finish-and-report testing approaches (also related to long-term testing).\n</li><li><strong>Append your laundry list items here</strong>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"subsection\"></span></p><h3>Milestones </h3>\n\n<p>TBD, still capturing requirements.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Sep-20 13:27:15 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm ready to start working on *this, and was hoping for upstream collaboration on it.
