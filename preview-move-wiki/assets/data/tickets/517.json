{"id": 517, "title": "Ticket #517: RFE: shadow reconnection on startd failure (esp VM universe)", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe reconnect code currently handles a schedd/shadow crash by allowing the shadow to reconnect to a starter. The reverse does not work. Typically this is not a problem since the loss of a startd/starter means the running job is killed, except in the corner case of master,startd,starter mass death. However, when considering the VM universe, the running VM may continue to run and is a candidate for reconnection.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jul-13 11:00:51 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nThis may also work as a step toward reconnection to starters in general - a feature with multiple benefits, including a path for startd upgrading.\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-11 16:35:11 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070902 to v070903 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-22 10:54:51 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070903 to v070904 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-05 10:58:27 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070904 to v070905 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-22 11:10:10 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070905 to v070906 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Apr-22 11:10", "status": "new", "created": "2009-May-27 09:45", "fixed_version": "2009-May-27 09:45", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "VM", "assigned_to": "tstclair", "derived_from": "#523", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
