Because spaces are as well (?!), we should change the list separator to a pipe before somebody gets bitten by this.\n\n</p><p>This will require changing the gahp client to call escapeGahpString() on each security group name.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Nov-07 16:58:54 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nEC2 \"classic\" security group names are restricted to \"ASCII characters\".  Testing indicates that Amazon ignores leading and trailing whitespace (convenient, since <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StringList\" title=\"String List\">StringList</a></span> does as well), but that will mean it's not simple to allow arbitrary security group names without doing something like \"+SecurityGroupName_1 = foo |, ]\" as the interface, which is distressing.
