{"id": 5327, "title": "Ticket #5327: Separate SPOOL for job files and service files", "description": "<blockquote>\nI'd like to request a feature that would add a new configuration option to separate system files stored in SPOOL from the location used to store job data.  Ideally files defined in SYSTEM_VALID_SPOOL_FILES could be stored in a location defined by something like SYSTEM_SPOOL while job stage-in and other related files would continue to be stored in SPOOL.\n\n<p>This was originally brought up and reasons outlined in OSG ticket <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/26864\">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/26864</a>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Oct-21 10:17", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Oct-21 10:17", "fixed_version": "2015-Oct-21 10:17", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "treydock", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
