See <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://goo.gl/964Tch\">this thread in htcondor-users.</a>  We currently implicitly add the libcgroup package, but kinda looks like the licgroup-tools package (to get the daemon) may also be required for HTCondor cgroup support?\n\n<p>Leave a remark in this ticket with an explanation of why (or why not) libcgroup-tools is required, and of course add it if needed.  :)\n\n</p><p>In addition, the packaging should configure cgroups for HTCondor if at all possible so that users just need to edit the HTCondor config file to enable (and not have to mess with other system files).  This may only be possible on systemd setups, not sure...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Apr-03 14:00:36 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nI think this should be added to RHEL6; it's the most (only?) reasonable way to setup and configure cgroups on that platform.\n\n<p>For RHEL7 - I think we should utilize the fact systemd sets up the cgroups for us (or, rather, <strong>can</strong> setup the cgroups.
