We should write a script that takes a git hash or tag and submits build, and then a whole lot of test( run)s of it, one for each networking config of interest.  (w/ a public IPv6 primary address, without using 127.0.0.1, using ::1, etc?  TJ had the thoughts.)  Then should run this script at least once per release candidate but maybe also nightly.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2015-Sep-29 15:39", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Sep-29 15:39", "fixed_version": "2015-Sep-29 15:39", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5247", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
