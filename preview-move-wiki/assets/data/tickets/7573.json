{"id": 7573, "title": "Ticket #7573: There should be private job attributes that other users cannot see", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor the jupyter batch spawner, there job environment is used a place to store secrets.  To make this secrets secure, we need a way to configure certain job attributes to be <em>private</em>, such that condor_q -long will only return them to authorized users.\n\n<p>The definition of what is a secret for now will be via configuration in the Schedd.  When a user uses condor_q with a modern HTCondor, they will normally authenticate.  When they do that identity will be checked and secret attributes in the job will be filtered or obfuscated by the Schedd unless the user is the Owner of the job, or a member of QUEUE_SUPER_USERS.\n\n</p><p>The job's Environment attribute should be secret by default.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:22", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Mar-30 16:21", "fixed_version": "2020-Mar-30 16:21", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
