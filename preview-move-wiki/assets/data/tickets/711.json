At the time, I did a hand test of the fix.  While I'm confident in the fix, it'd be good to have an automated test for it.\n\n<p>I started work on modifying test_log_writer to provide multiple threads of execution (actually, UNIX forks).  This would be used to test the above, as well as provide the framework for some other new tests of the log writing code, as well, including a test for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=601\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('601'); return false;\" title=\"Event log rotation on Win32 probably broken with &gt;1 writer process\">#601</a></span>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:22", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Sep-03 13:12", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-03 13:12", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "nleroy", "derived_from": "#561", "creator": "nleroy", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
