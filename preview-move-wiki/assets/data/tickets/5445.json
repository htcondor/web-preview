{"id": 5445, "title": "Ticket #5445: Add support for workflow log to be on SSD", "description": "<blockquote>\nI had suggested a while ago that we put workflow logs for CHTC on SSDs for performance improvement.  Just doing that wouldn't require any DAGMan changes, but we're thinking that, when the workflow finishes, DAGMan should move the log off of the SSD (e.g., to the directory where the DAG file lives).  This would require some support in DAGMan.\n\n<p>Also, we'd have to decide what to do if the file moved failed (e.g., if there's not enough disk space in the directory we're moving to).  My first thought is to put the DAGMan job on hold, with an appropriate hold reason.  Then the user could clear out disk space and release the job, and it should re-try moving the log file.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Dec-17 15:44", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Dec-17 15:44", "fixed_version": "2015-Dec-17 15:44", "broken_version": "v080501", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
