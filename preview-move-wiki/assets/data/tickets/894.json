Configure fails because it can't find libgcc_s.so.1 and libstdc++.so.5.  Both are present, but in 64-bit versions, which aren't helpful.\n\n</p><p>Hypothesis: Something changed in the machine's configuration.  Perhaps it was reimaged, or \"unnecessary\" 32-bit compatibility libraries were removed.  I'm working with NMI to sort it out.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 17:46", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Nov-02 17:49", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-02 17:49", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "#759", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
