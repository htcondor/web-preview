{"id": 3066, "title": "Ticket #3066: create a tool to tell condor that the machine is going to sleep", "description": "<blockquote>\nSome pool administrators have a situation where condor is a guest on a set of machines that may be put to sleep for some reason.  They need a way to ask condor to put the machine into the sleeping state in the central mananger even though condor_rooster isn't being used to put the machines to sleep.\n\n<p>This request came from <span class=\"quote\">Stephen McGough</span> at Newcastle U.  He writes:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\nWe have a Windows based cluster where we have a pre-existing (to Condor) mechanism to allow computers to go to sleep when idle for longer than a set amount of time. Given that we couldn't persuade the powers that be to use the Condor mechanism to sleep computers we opted to write a small piece of code which posts a replacement class-ad to the collector (using condor_advertise) with an offline status for the box. This is obviously fragile as if Condor itself posts a new class-ad before the box enters the sleep state then the status is lost. Also if anything changes in Condor about how a resource works then our code will be broken.\n\n<p>It would therefore be ideal if we could have a condor_sleep (or something similar) command which will set up an offline status for the resource.</p></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-28 15:32", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jun-18 13:40", "fixed_version": "2012-Jun-18 13:40", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
