{"id": 4462, "title": "Ticket #4462: Parent-child security sessions never expire", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen a daemon spawns a child daemon, it creates a security session for the two to use. This security session has an infinite lifetime and isn't explicitly removed when the child exits. It also punches a hole in the authorization table for the child's identity, but never fills it back in. This is particularly troublesome for the schedd and startd, which spawn a new child process for each running job.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Jul-30 10:07:26 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe security session for the child is removed by the parent when it reaps the child. Nothing to see here. Move along.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2014-Jul-30 10:07", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2014-Jul-15 10:42", "fixed_version": "2014-Jul-15 10:42", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#4405", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
