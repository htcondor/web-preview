Sadly, this is a stripped binary, so I can't look closely.  Current guess: libpthread is detecting internal corruption and abort()ing.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Sep-20 17:28:20 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nstartds have crashed about 150 times in CHTC's e0* and c0* machines since the August 1st.  47 of them look similar to this stack trace.  These are worrying numbers, but doesn't immediately fincer the startd as a particular problem.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Sep-20 21:11:01 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nResearch so far is collected at: /p/condor/workspaces/adesmet/startd-crash.tar.gz . In particular it contains backtraces for all startd core dumps since the beginning of August and log excerpts.\n\n<p>I don't see a clear correlation to partitionable slots and these aborts. Most of the machines that crashed do have partitionable slots, but 4 (c022, c032, c034, and c042) don't.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Sep-24 14:09:18 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nAttached stack-summaries, a summary of stack dumps on crashed startds on CHTC e0* and c0* machines, September 1, 2012 through September 20, 2012.\n\n<p>Fetchwork does leak the pack, responsible for a comfortable majority.  But there are other sources.  And while a failing in read() while spawning fetchwork does have the plurality, there are other crashes in different parts of fetchwork.\n\n</p><p>While there are exceptions, these are overwhelmingly exceptions from SIGABORT, and from libpthread (read() and write()) or libc (select()).  This suggests memory corruption that libc detects and panics over.\n\n</p><p>Will see if infrastructure will let me replace a startd with one running under valgrind, let it run a day or so, and see if anything interesting pops up.  Should also run on my own system with a trivial workload as a basic smoke test.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Sep-25 15:37:20 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nNo immediate results or obvious evidence of corruption on local tests.  Possible regression of clone() was considered; code appears to disable clone in the startd as expected.\n\n<p>Immediate plans: ask infrastructure to turn off workfetch. Revisit in a week or two and see if the crash rate has significantly changed.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/637/stack-summaries\">stack-summaries</a>\n18156 bytes added by adesmet on 2012-Sep-24 19:04:38 UTC.\n<br/>\nSummaries of stacks from crashes startds in CHTC's e0* and c0* machines, Sep 1, 2012-Sep 20, 2012<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2013-May-29 16:00", "status": "stalled", "created": "2012-Sep-19 14:11", "fixed_version": "2012-Sep-19 14:11", "broken_version": "v070900", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
