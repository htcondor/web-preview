{"id": 1136, "title": "Ticket #1136: Eliminate \"static\" releases of Condor", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe ship static binaries on the theory that they are widely portable.  This was true once, but at least on Linux our static binaries are less portable because libc insists on loading other libraries at runtime, hitting versioning problems.  Our dynamic binaries have proven to be more portable.  We recommend the dynamic binaries and have for some time.  We believe almost no one uses the static binaries, and people who are can probably use the dynamic binaries.\n\n<p>Conclusion: stop building and shipping static binaries.\n\n</p><p>Benefits:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Less user confusion about which version to build.\n</li><li>Fewer Rust tickets helping people having problems with the static binaries.\n</li><li>Less disk space for us. (Disk usage causes NMI disk and network grief, fills our quotas in AFS, means we need to burn a pile of DVDs for backups which is a nuisance.)\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>See also <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1135\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1135'); return false;\" title='\"Real\" dynamic binary releases'>#1135</a></span> (\"Real\" dynamic binary releases) which proposes changes to how we build our dynamic binaries.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>User feedback</h2>\nSee the \"User feedback\" on <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1135\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1135'); return false;\" title='\"Real\" dynamic binary releases'>#1135</a></span>.
