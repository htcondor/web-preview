This is preventing the job from <em>ever</em> leaving the queue (via SYSTEM_PERIODIC_REMOVE or condor_rm). This runs counter to leave_in_queue's documented behavior, where \"the job remains in the queue until the user runs condor_rm to remove the job from the queue\".\n\n<p>I have suggested a workaround, but we should resolve this code/documentation inconsistency. I plan to bring this up in the FW meeting today.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-03 14:04:30 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nI've fixed the error in the leave_in_queue description on the condor_submit man page.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:16", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jan-30 08:57", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-30 08:57", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "gquinn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "s7772", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
