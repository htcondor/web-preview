(In fact, they are also not reported as running in the \"normal\" collector of the pool they flock to.)  We suspect that there's some problem in the logic in Scheduler::count_jobs() that messes around with the job counts when reporting to \"flocked to\" pools.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:47", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-09 10:37", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-09 10:37", "broken_version": "v070201", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "a19193", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
