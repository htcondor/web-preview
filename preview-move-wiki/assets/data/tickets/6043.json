{"id": 6043, "title": "Ticket #6043: Fix pslot preemption for parallel universe jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe dedicated scheduler doesn't know how to request a claim that involves pslot preemption. It ignores the claims for the dslots, and can't claim the pslot because it has insufficient resources.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Dec-06 14:08:35 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis fix is more involved then I initially thought. The dedicated scheduler pulls machine ads from the collector and does its own matchmaking before talking to the negotiator. If it doesn't see machine ads that satisfy the requirements of its jobs, it doesn't send those jobs to the negotiator. So it needs code equivalent to the pslot preemption code in the negotiator.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-Dec-14 10:47", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Dec-06 11:18", "fixed_version": "2016-Dec-06 11:18", "broken_version": "v080400", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#3667", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "jfrey@cs.wisc.edu,carsten.aulbert@ligo.org,michael.v.pelletier@raytheon.com", "due_date": ""}
