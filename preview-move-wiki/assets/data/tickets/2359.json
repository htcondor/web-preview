{"id": 2359, "title": "Ticket #2359: nordugrid_gahp missing from Debian builds", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe nordugrid_gahp binary is missing from our Debian releases. This is because the nmi debian machines don't have the ldap development package installed. Our build scripts skip building nordugrid_gahp in this case.\n\n<p>[nmi-support #9644] requests installing package libldap2-dev on the nmi build machines. We should also make the build fail if ldap is missing on a linux machine.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Aug-05 17:09:37 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe nordugrid_gahp is needed for both nordugrid and cream jobs.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Aug-15 11:44:36 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe required ldap packages are now present on x86_deb_5.0 and x86_64_deb_6.0-updated.
