In particular, the following is missing:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Recent number of job starts.\n</li><li>Recent number of shadow starts.\n</li><li>Recent image size (memory usage).\n</li><li>Recent average job run time.\n</li><li>Recent average job data transfer.\n</li><li>Recent average data rate.\nProbably doing the averages over 1 hour is sufficient.  I've CC'd Mats Rynge so he can provide details about the current OSG implementation.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>The \"-wide\" option doesn't seem to work well with the second table; we should also fix that.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Sep-23 10:38:52 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nI what way is -wide option not working?
