{"id": 2822, "title": "Ticket #2822: Improve cleanup of chroot execute dirs", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight now, the chroot implementation has a few drawbacks:\n<ul>\n<li>It creates $CHROOT/var/lib/condor/execute with too-restrictive permissions if it doesn't already exist.\n</li><li>It implements the parsing of the NAMED_CHROOT param twice via the miracle of copy/paste\n</li><li>It bind-mounts /var/lib/condor/execute -&gt; $CHROOT/var/lib/condor/execute.  If we would instead bind-mount /var/lib/condor/execute/dir_12345 -&gt; $CHROOT/var/lib/condor/execute/dir_12345, the running jobs wouldn't be able to scribble in each other's sandbox, even if they are running as the same unix user.\n<ul>\n<li>This is an important isolation/security protection!\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>If (3) is implemented, we would need to cleanup the various dir_12345 directories in the starter and startd.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>All simple things to fix; patch incoming.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Apr-10 14:57:26 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nI've cherry-picked onto V7_8-branch, as there is no major functionality changes, they are minor cleanup fixes which I think would be nice to have in the next stable seeing how the 1st introduction of this feature is in the 7.7 series.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"attach_get/532/chroot_sandbox_remap_v1.patch\">chroot_sandbox_remap_v1.patch</a>\n14821 bytes added by bbockelm on 2012-Feb-13 01:35:58 UTC.\n<br/>\nImplementation of all points mentioned above.<br/>\n</li><li><a href=\"attach_get/539/chroot_sandbox_remap_v2.patch\">chroot_sandbox_remap_v2.patch</a>\n12915 bytes added by bbockelm on 2012-Mar-10 18:05:22 UTC.\n<br/>\nVersion 2 of the patch, fixing permissions issues discovered in testing.\n\n<p>Greg - we've had this on about 1,000 cores for around a month.
