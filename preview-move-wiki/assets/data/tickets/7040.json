{"id": 7040, "title": "Ticket #7040: Allow preemption of one dslot using additional resources from pslot", "description": "<blockquote>\nLIGO is running a large pool with pslots.  They have observed that when there is a mix of single core jobs with different memory requirements, often preemption of a single small dslot can't happen because the preempting job requires more memory than the dslot has.  Often in this case, the pslot is holding enough unused memory to \"give\" to the dslot to run.\n\n<p>To get this to work today, we would need to enable multiple dslot preemption, which has a host of caveats.\n\n</p><p>LIGO would like a simpler, more correct solution that would just use resources from the pslot.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2021-May-04 10:44:04 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\n(Note -- now jira HTCONDOR-467)</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2021-May-18 10:47", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-May-08 14:54", "fixed_version": "2019-May-08 14:54", "broken_version": "v080900", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
