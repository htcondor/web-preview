I couldn't find it using the search functionality.  Redhat BZ is <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=676260\">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=676260</a>.  I've personally seen this at three different installs, so it's worth reporting.\n\n<p>The SIGABRT exception handler will write out a stack trace into the log.  If the SIGABRT is caught while Condor is root and when the logfile is rotated, then Condor will create the logfile as root.  After the daemon is restarted by the master, it will crash immediately because the logfile is unavailable.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2012-Sep-26 13:39", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Apr-27 16:52", "fixed_version": "2012-Apr-27 16:52", "broken_version": "v070700", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
