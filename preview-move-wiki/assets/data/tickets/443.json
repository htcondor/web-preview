{"id": 443, "title": "Ticket #443: Fix DAGMan depth-first implementation", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe current depth-first implementation is really kludgey -- we change the order that nodes are added to the ready queue, and in some cases it doesn't really do things depth-first.  We want to change the DFS implementation to use node priorities instead.  We might be able to do this by having the DFSVisit() method set node priorities.  One issue, though, is what to do if the user already has some node priorities explicitly set in the DAG -- should we override them or not?  Maybe there should be a knob for that?</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-30 15:36", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-30 15:36", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
