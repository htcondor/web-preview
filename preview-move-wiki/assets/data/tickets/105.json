{"id": 105, "title": "Ticket #105: PrivSep: disk usage can be underreported", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen gathering disk usage information about a running job, the Starter recurses through the sandbox adding up file sizes. In <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> mode, this can result in some files not being accounted for since the Starter can only do this as Condor's UID and may not have permission to stat some of the files.\n\n<p>Fixing this seems to require adding a \"du\" operation to the <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> Switchboard. The Switchboard already has code to safely walk the sandbox file tree, so this would be a pretty small change.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:20", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-26 09:48", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-26 09:48", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
