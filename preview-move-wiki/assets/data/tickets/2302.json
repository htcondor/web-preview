This should be improved.\n\n</p><p>Normally, all communication between the schedd and startd happens via match password security sessions, so GSI should not be necessary.  However, Condor falls back to creating a new security session if anything goes wrong with the creation of the match password session.\n\n</p><p>Some attempts to create match password security sessions are failing.  This is due to pre-existing entries in the session cache, based on the following log:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>07/13/11 14:32:40 (pid:19461) SECMAN: failed to create session &lt;10.1.3.72:58072&gt;#1310575699#5.\n07/13/11 14:32:40 (pid:19461) SEC_ENABLE_MATCH_PASSWORD_AUTHENTICATION: failed to create security session for &lt;10.1.3.72:58072&gt;#1310575699#5#\n..., so will try to obtain a new security session\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Why would the session already exist in the cache?  Hash key collision?  Reuse of the same claim id?  (When a match is deleted the old session is kept around for 10 minutes, so there is a 10 minute window in which reuse of the same claim id would collide.)  More information needs to be added to the log when a collision occurs in order to diagnose the problem.\n\n</p><p>It may be a good idea to have a mode in which the match password session is not optional.  This would prevent the fallback to potentially performance-killing authentication protocols.\n\n</p><p>In the mean time, I have recommended a much smaller timeout during authentication with a setting such as this:\n\n</p><p>SEC_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION_TIMEOUT = 5</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jul-14 12:02:47 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI have fixed the only case that I am aware of that could explain the failure to create the match password session.
