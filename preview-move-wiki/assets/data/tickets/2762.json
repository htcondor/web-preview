The reason is that the 1s timeout in <code>DaemonCore</code> for receipt of a command is being exceeded, perhaps because an ad gets split across multiple packets and network failures introduce a delay.\n\n<p>It would be nice if the tool could retry sending the failed ads.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Jan-13 11:32", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jan-13 11:32", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-13 11:32", "broken_version": "v070705", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "isfiligoi@ucsd.edu,dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
