For instance, a common reason in the VM universe would be because of a failure to launch.  Other common reasons might include the job being preempted, the machine failing, or the running past its allotted time.\n\n<p>We currently record many of these reasons in the user log, but doing so in the job ad has two benefits: it makes it easier to run without the log; and it if we choose the attributes carefully, should permit better policy-making.\n\n</p><p>The latter suggests we should follow the HoldReason[[Sub]Code] pattern.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Aug-18 13:17", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Aug-18 13:17", "fixed_version": "2014-Aug-18 13:17", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, cat@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
