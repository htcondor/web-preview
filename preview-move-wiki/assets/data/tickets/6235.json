{"id": 6235, "title": "Ticket #6235: user priv switching using AFS session keyrings could cache more UIDs", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently when switching to and from USER_PRIV and acquiring AFS tokens we only cache the keyring ID of the most recently accessed user.  We could cache the keyring ID of every user that we looked up to minimize the number of system calls made to find keyrings.  This could make the schedd more scalable when using session keyrings, although we currently don't have any measurements one way or the other.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Apr-26 11:04", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Apr-26 11:04", "fixed_version": "2017-Apr-26 11:04", "broken_version": "v080700", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cern", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
