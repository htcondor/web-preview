{"id": 4218, "title": "Ticket #4218: Merge gridmanager's queries of job ads from schedd", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe gridmanager makes two different queries of job ads to the schedd. One is for new jobs the gridmanager should be managing. The other is looking for jobs managed by the gridmanager whose status has changed to Held, Removed, or Completed (and the gridmanager needs to react to that change).\n\n<p>The second query is done on every connection to the schedd. The first is done on startup and whenever the schedd sends an ADD_JOBS or REMOVE_JOBS signal to the gridmanager. These two queries could be combined, so that the schedd only has to iterate once over the job queue.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Feb-18 17:27", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Feb-18 17:26", "fixed_version": "2014-Feb-18 17:26", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#4216", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
