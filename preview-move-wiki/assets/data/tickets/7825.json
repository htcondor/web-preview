{"id": 7825, "title": "Ticket #7825: Skip blahp check of proxy symlinks on refresh when not needed", "description": "<blockquote>\nVanderbilt ran into errors with their CEs that would occur after the Gridmanager sent a GM_REFRESH_PROXY command <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/9b89c8b1bf74329d497bfc336eb2e99345f69183\">[1]</a></span> to the Blahp. The Blahp creates symlinks in the user's home directories that point to the location of the old proxy. These are needed when the blahp creates a new proxy file as part of job submission (when the blahp is configured to create a limited proxy for the job and when glexec is used). Neither of these cases occurs with HTCondor-CE. The blahp checks for the symlink on a proxy refresh even if these options aren't in use. Vanderbilt turned out to not have a home directory for the user in question so the Blahp failed when the Gridmanager told the Blahp to renew the proxy at the symlink location.\n\n<p>The blahp should be fixed to not check for the proxy file symlink when it's not needed. Additionally, the gridmanager could be given a parameter to suppress the GM_REFRESH_PROXY command to the blahp.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/9b89c8b1bf74329d497bfc336eb2e99345f69183\">[1]</a></span> <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=ticket_info&amp;ticket_id=148149\">https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=ticket_info&amp;ticket_id=148149</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Oct-05 13:11:57 by blin:</em> <br/>\n\nThis made it into v1.18.48 of the blahp: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/BLAH/releases/tag/v1.18.48\">https://github.com/htcondor/BLAH/releases/tag/v1.18.48</a>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Oct-19 12:58:09 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review:</strong> Looks good to me\n\n<p>Not sure where any version history belongs.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Oct-19 22:29</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/0488de40fda2988e879ff81bf39ea6887e0d64a9\">[61524]</a></span>: Docs for blahp proxy refresh bug fix. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7825\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7825'); return false;\" title=\"Skip blahp check of proxy symlinks on refresh when not needed\">#7825</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Sep-01 17:22</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/8a33755106db30342cbf1f71a4f0891f74fa192b\">[61187]</a></span>: Patch blahp to skip proxy symlinks on refresh when not needed. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=7825\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7825'); return false;\" title=\"Skip blahp check of proxy symlinks on refresh when not needed\">#7825</a></span> On a BLAH_JOB_REFRESH_PROXY command, the blahp no longer complains about not finding a symlink to the old proxy under $(HOME)/.blah_jobproxy_dir/ if it doesn't need to find the file.
