{"id": 3213, "title": "Ticket #3213: Could libexec/condor_ssh_to_job_shell_setup be sh?", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe Condor tarballs distribute a script, libexec/condor_ssh_to_job_shell_setup, whose #! line is /bin/bash.  This binary doesn't exist by default on FreeBSD 7.x, and so causes ssh-to-job to fail.  It's not that it's a problem to fix (by switching to /usr/local/bin/bash), but that the file is in libexec/, so we don't normally think that we keep configuration information in there.  The other two Condor SSH scripts just do #!/bin/sh, which works fine, so it'd be nice if condor_ssh_to_job_shell_setup could be changed to match.  (I haven't looked at any of the scipts, but hopefully whoever wrote them still remembers them and can very quickly answer the question.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Sep-19 16:15:53 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070804 to v070805 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Oct-25 17:52:16 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070806 to v070807 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-19 09:30:47 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070807 to v070808 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-28 17:16:00 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070808 to v070809 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Mar-28 17:16", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Aug-28 16:30", "fixed_version": "2012-Aug-28 16:30", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
