{"id": 3960, "title": "Ticket #3960: VM universe should test guest networking", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt is possible for a hypervisor to (claim to) permit networking by its guests without actually (successfully) doing so.  It may have never worked, or stopped working while HTCondor was running.  Therefore, it does not suffice to test guest networking on HTCondor start up.\n\n<p>This causes any job which required networking to not succeed.  (The VM universe job may or may complete, depending on the image in question.)  This is at best annoying for our users.\n\n</p><p>(This may be closely related to the request (ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=3789\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3789'); return false;\" title=\"Test VM support like we test Java support.\">#3789</a></span>) for testing VM functionality like the Java universe.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Oct-02 15:26", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Oct-02 15:26", "fixed_version": "2013-Oct-02 15:26", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "VM", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "cat@cs.wisc.edu, tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
