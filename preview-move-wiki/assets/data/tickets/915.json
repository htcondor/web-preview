Seems like asking him how long he ran the Google heap tracer and/or asking him to run it for a longer period of time would be good.\n\n<p>Joe was not on the phone call I had this morning w/ Fermi folks, but he is still concerned about it.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-09 11:54:06 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nI've updated the rust ticket.\n\n<p>It sure looks like a memory leak, but it is almost certainly something specific to fnal.
