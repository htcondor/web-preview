{"id": 207, "title": "Ticket #207: Remove GRIDMANAGER_ MAX_ PENDING_ SUBMITS_ PER_ RESOURCE", "description": "<blockquote>\nGRIDMANAGER_MAX_PENDING_SUBMITS_PER_RESOURCE has probably out-lived its usefulness. It was originally added for gt2 jobs, when too many simultaneous jobmanager startups caused inetd's DoS alarms to trigger. Now, most sane values of GRIDMANAGER_MAX_JOBMANAGERS_PER_RESOURCE will provide the same benefit. For non-gt2 jobs, it doesn't make sense to place a throttle on the number of simultaneous submit requests; throttling across all requests is what you want.\n\n<p>With Igor Sfiligoi, we found that GRIDMANAGER_MAX_PENDING_SUBMITS_PER_RESOURCE can negate the benefit of splitting the GRIDMANAGER_MAX_JOBMANAGERS_PER_RESOURCE throttle between submits and restarts. Since the former throttle is checked first and it isn't split between submits and restarts, new job submissions can get stuck behind a large wave of job completions or removals waiting for the former throttle before reaching their guaranteed half set of slots for the latter throttle. The reverse is also true. We recommended that he set GRIDMANAGER_MAX_PENDING_SUBMITS_PER_RESOURCE to effectively infinity.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Apr-29 13:50:47 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nChange checked in on V7_3-bnl_atlas-branch.
