{"id": 7704, "title": "Ticket #7704: Ensure condor_gpu_discovery reports CoresPerCU for Volta and later GPU", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe conditional was originally added before ConvertSMVer2Cores contained mappings for Volta and later GPUs (which have since been added). However, even if they hadn't been added, the conditional is probably unnecessary since ConvertSMVer2Cores will default to returning the values for the last known generation (which is probably better than omitting the property entirely from condor_gpu_discovery output).\n\n<p>Might be worth a separate discussion about how best to alert the user if they are using a newer GPU than that accounted for in ConvertSMVer2Cores?\n\n</p><p>If this could also be merged into the 8.8 branch too that would be great (we use the CoresPerCU attribute to calculate TFLOPS for each GPU, which is then used in the slot ranking)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Jun-25 06:46:58 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/pull/117\">https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/pull/117</a>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Jul-31 10:52:56 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW:</strong> Looks good.
