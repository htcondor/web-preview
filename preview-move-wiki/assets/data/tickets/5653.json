That wouldn't help with the other things, though.\n\n</p><p>Hmm -- now that I think about it, maybe the way to do it is to have a Dag object for the splice (attached to the PRE splice node?).  If we did that, though, we'd have to do something special to have throttles that applied <strong>across</strong> splices.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Nov-06 21:21:52 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThe new ALL_NODES feature should pretty much give us this for maxjobs -- you can do this:\n\n<p></p><pre>  # Within the splice DAG file\n  CATEGORY ALL_NODES my_cat\n  MAXJOBS my_cat 5\n</pre>\n\n<p>but for maxpre, maxpost, and maxidle this doesn't do any good.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Nov-06 21:21", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Apr-28 15:02", "fixed_version": "2016-Apr-28 15:02", "broken_version": "v080504", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, miron@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
