{"id": 5452, "title": "Ticket #5452: HTCondor View: add tool link to cycle chart type.", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf the chart type is one of stacked, line, or dygraph, add another entry to the tool overlay (.editmenu) \"alt view\" or similar. Clicking it will switch the chart to the next entry in the cycle of stacked &gt; line &gt; dygraph.\n\n<p>Immediate goal: generally stacked is the most enlightening for our purposes. But when a data value is 0, you can't hover to see the values hiding \"under\" it. You can see the data in chart=line or chart=dygraph. Making it easy to switch would be nice.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Dec-23 13:51", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Dec-23 13:51", "fixed_version": "2015-Dec-23 13:51", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5351", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
