{"id": 4768, "title": "Ticket #4768: Forward refreshed proxies for nordugrid jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\n<span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=NorduGrid\" title=\"Nordu Grid\">NorduGrid</a></span> ARC allows the client to refresh the X.509 proxy for their jobs. It provides a command line tool called arcrenew to do so. We should take advantage of that ability in Condor for nordugrid grid universe jobs.\n\n<p>The arcrenew tool is probably using ARC's gridftp interface to do the proxy renewals. We should be able to perform the same set of ftp commands.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Mar-16 14:21:04 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nTo renew the proxy for a job, the ARC client connects to the gridftp server and issues the following commands:\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">CWD /jobs\nCWD &lt;jobidnum&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I don't know if the Globus gridftp client will take a relative path for the CWD command, or if the server requires a relative path for the CWD command.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Mar-26 16:35:12 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI have written code to support proxy renewal. But it requires testing.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-Mar-26 16:35", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Dec-11 10:43", "fixed_version": "2014-Dec-11 10:43", "broken_version": "v080200", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cern", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
