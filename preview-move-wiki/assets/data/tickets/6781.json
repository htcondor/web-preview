{"id": 6781, "title": "Ticket #6781: collector should allow wildcard projections for condor_status queries", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere are several situations where users want to query the collector and get all of the attributes of an ad that match a particular pattern.  For instance, to get all of the information about GPUs, you would want to query all of the attributes with names that start with CUDA.\n\n<p>Right now they are forced to query ALL of the attributes, and then filter the results themselves.  It would be better if the collector supported some form of wildcard projection. Something like\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    condor_status -af CUDA*\n</pre>\n\n<p>or\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    condor_status -af /CUDA.*/\n</pre>\n\n<p>We should investigate which of these can be done more efficiently in the collector and do that.   Then modify condor_status to support it.  At some future date we could do the same for job  queries in the schedd.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Apr-10 15:18:53 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom the LIGO perspective this would be neat but is unimportant.
