The intention was for these messages to always be written to the primary schedd log, and also be written to a D_AUDIT-only log (if configured). In reality, they are only written if the D_AUDIT level is enabled.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2017-Jun-20 14:27", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Jun-20 14:27", "fixed_version": "2017-Jun-20 14:27", "broken_version": "v070906", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#3563", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
