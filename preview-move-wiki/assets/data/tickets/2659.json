There were conflicting entries for the condor user; one was in /etc/passwd and the other was in NSS.  These two entries had different home directories.  The entry in /etc/passwd was likely created by the RPM installation.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Sep-21 11:28", "status": "defer", "created": "2011-Nov-23 08:58", "fixed_version": "2011-Nov-23 08:58", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "s8101", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
