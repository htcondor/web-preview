{"id": 6541, "title": "Ticket #6541: Default campus factory config interferes with other BOSCO uses", "description": "<blockquote>\nMarco opened an OSG ticket about <code>60-campus_factory.config</code> being bad default config that doesn't make sense for many condor configs. Since it's a nightmare to format text in gittrac, his original description follows in plain text:\n\n<p></p><hr/>\nThe file 60-campus_factory.config is included in condor-bosco.\n\n<p>This file changes security, ports and running daemons configurations that interfere with systems that use BOSCO but are not running a campus factory: e.g. GlideinWMS Factory, BOSCO installations, people installing condor-all...\n\n</p><p>The file could be removed after the installation but comes back at each update\n\n</p><p>I was wondering if it could be moved to a separate package or a least not override admin changes with updates.\n\n</p><p>A workaround at the moment is to remove it and replace it with an empty file.\n\n</p><p>Thanks</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Oct-30 15:14:51 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nNo version history.
