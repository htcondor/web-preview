{"id": 7884, "title": "Ticket #7884: Update condor_vacate man page", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe current condor_vacate man page is both a wasteland and misleading.  It is misleading, because it mentions checkpointing, which is generally not a thing any more; it is a wasteland because of a vast lack of specificity as to what it actually does to jobs.  Even just linking to the relevant section of the manual -- assuming we have one -- about what the different kind of vacates do and how they interact with various different config knobs (and job attributes), max job retirement time specifically included -- would be a vast improvement.\n\n<p>The text from condor_vacate_job might also be a good place to start.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2020-Oct-12 11:57", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Oct-12 11:57", "fixed_version": "2020-Oct-12 11:57", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
