The patch file src/condor_daemon_core.V6/stdsoap2.h.patch comments out thread-related #defines for AIX in the generated file src/condor_includes/stdsoap2.h.\n\n<p>Since the amazon_gahp uses gsoap and threads, it won&amp;#8217;t work with our usage of gsoap on AIX. Problems with incorrect errno values were observed in testing, due to _THREAD_SAFE not being defined.\n\n</p><p>For now, the amazon_gahp is disabled for AIX.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Nov-04 13:44:17 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nI propose this be closed WONTFIX</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2009-Dec-26 20:46", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Jan-23 16:47", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-23 16:47", "broken_version": "v070200", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
