{"id": 3832, "title": "Ticket #3832: Improve searching of EC2 jobs by ssh keypair name", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen dealing with EC2 services that don't support the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClientToken\" title=\"Client Token\">ClientToken</a></span> instance parameter, EC2Resource::StartBatchStatus() has to find some jobs based on the ssh keypair name. The current search algorithm is an inefficient linear scan of jobs for each unmatched instance. This should be improved. We could pluck the job id out of the keypair name, if the name looks like one we generated.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Aug-06 10:44", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Aug-06 10:44", "fixed_version": "2013-Aug-06 10:44", "broken_version": "v080101", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#3682", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
