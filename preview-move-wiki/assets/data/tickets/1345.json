{"id": 1345, "title": "Ticket #1345: Clearly document cross-platform portability", "description": "<blockquote>\nI was recently contacted by a user who wanted binaries for RHEL4 and didn't see them on the web site.  They didn't realize that the RHEL3 binaries work fine on RHEL4.  We hide that information in several different non-obvious places, all of which are slightly out of date and disagree with each other.\n\n<p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=PortsTable\">http://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=PortsTable</a>\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/porting/port_table.html\">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/porting/port_table.html</a>\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.4/1_5Availability.html#948\">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.4/1_5Availability.html#948</a>\n\n</p><p>This is a mess.\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>We should have canonical information in one place, not three.  We might automatically copy that information elsewhere, but updating that information should be done in one place, not three.\n\n<p></p></li><li>The download page (that is, the page which lets the user select binaries for download, e.g. <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads-v2/download.pl?state=select_from_mirror_page&amp;version=7.4.2&amp;mirror=UW%20Madison&amp;optional_organization_url=http://\">this one</a>) should include this information.  Ideally it should be copied from the canonical location directly into the table, adding additional rows that point to the same binaries elsewhere in the table.  If the user selects the same binary several times, the download page should note the platforms the user selected so he knows why, say, 3 platforms turned into 2 downloads.  If that proves too complex, at least have a prominent link at the top, \"My platform isn't list\" or similar, with a link to the canonical table.</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Apr-16 13:49", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Apr-13 10:38", "fixed_version": "2010-Apr-13 10:38", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
