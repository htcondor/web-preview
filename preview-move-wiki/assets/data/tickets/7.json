{"id": 7, "title": "Ticket #7: Run HDFS services as Condor daemons", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom Faisal Khan:\n\n<p>I have a working version of a Condor daemon for \"pseudo-daemoncore-ify\"\nthe Hadoop storage. The gist of my implementation\nis to configure Hadoop's storage based on condor_config file and spawn\nappropriate Hadoop's services as Java processes using\nmethods from Daemon Core library.  I tried to provide default values for\nmany of the parameters and there is still possibilities to\nprovide defaults for others as well. The Daemon Core  commands for start,\nstop (graceful/fast) and reconfiguration are handled based\non the hadoop's own installation shell scripts.  Additionally, the log4j\nbased logger of Hadoop is also configured to write a\nrolling log file under the CONDOR_LOCAL/log directory.\n\n</p><p>I  have placed my implementation  along with other necessary files at\n/p/condor/workspaces/faisal/condor_hadoop_v2.\n\n</p><p>Here is a small note on the contents of  above mentioned  directory:\n\n</p><p> condor_hadoop: Directory containing code for hadoop daemon (named as\nHDFS), 'Imakefile' for compilation\n                'libhdfs' folder for an example of using storage client\nwritten in C++\n                using JNI (Java native interface), provided by Hadoop.\n\n</p><p> hadoop: Directory containing hadoop binaries from version 0.17.\n\n</p><p> condor_config: Condor's usual configuration file that contains settings\nfor running HDFS.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jan-15 11:25:56 by khahn:</em> <br/>\n\nI found a couple small things when installing the code on CHTC:\n\n<p>* In what appears to be a functioning data service daemon we receive log output indicating:\n\n</p><p>1/14 18:13:27 dup2 of m_std[0] failed: Bad file descriptor (9)\n\n</p><p>* on a node where we are only running the data service we see a file created:\nstderr_namenode\nas defined in HADOOP_NAMENODE_STDOUT\n\n</p><p>*In general, hadoop as applied here is missing any security.\nWe are going to temporarily use some deployed iptables rules to block ports:\n#50010 - this port is assigned in condor configuration for the data node\n#50070 - statically assigned in hadoop conf directly - web server with stats\n#90000 - name node runs on this port (faisal needs to confirm this)\n\n</p><p>Additionally it would be nice to be able to assign all of those ports in the condor configuration (and dictate who could connect to them.. tcp_wrappers style).  (I am also suspicious that other ports are in play..such as 50075. I haven't looked too hard at it yet.. this is what faisal gave me for ports used).\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jan-23 14:03:47 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nI've completed a code review and sent a list of comments to Faisal.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jan-26 14:02:27 by faisal:</em> <br/>\n\nHeard back from Greg Q. regarding code review of hadoop daemon. Currently looking at few quick fixes. Will probably talk to Greg about the remaining comments.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-04 21:49:07 by faisal:</em> <br/>\n\nFinished making changes. I will try to show these changes to Greg to possibly have another look before giving it to Todd for commit.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-06 11:57:19 by faisal:</em> <br/>\n\nPlaced new version at /p/condor/workspaces/faisal/condor_hadoop_v3\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-23 09:38:20 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm assigning this to me again, since I need to give it another code review.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-02 17:04:21 by faisal:</em> <br/>\n\nChecked in my code and merged it with the V7_3 development branch few weeks ago.
