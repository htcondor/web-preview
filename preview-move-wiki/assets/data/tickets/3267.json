{"id": 3267, "title": "Ticket #3267: Optimize condor_history for queries by job id or owner", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen condor_history is run with a constraint for the job ads to display, it reads each full ad, parses it, decides whether the user wants it, and possibly displays it. When condor_history runs in backwards mode (the default), the ad separator lines that point at the start of the preceding ad also provides the job's cluster and proc id and the owner. If the user provides a cluster/proc or job owner as a constraint on the command line, then condor_history can skip non-matching ads (no reading or parsing) based on reading only the separator line. This can save a lot of time when searching for a specific job from a large history file.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 15:18", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Oct-15 14:45", "fixed_version": "2012-Oct-15 14:45", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
