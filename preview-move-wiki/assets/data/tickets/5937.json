{"id": 5937, "title": "Ticket #5937: Improve schedd job ClassAds transformation documentation", "description": "<blockquote>\nToddT suggestions for improvements to documentation:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>Copy syntax from job router section instead of linking to that.\n</li><li>Have more references to other parts of the manual (e.g., config knobs).\n</li><li>Make sure cases are consistent (to not generate multiple index entries) (e.g., job_route_name?)\n</li><li>Add more high-level discussion of why you'd want to do job transforms (e.g., not done by condor_submit, so they work the same if user submits via Python bindings, user can't bypass them).  (Contrast with submit_attrs.)\n</li><li>Re-do examples -- have a very simple initial example (like just adding a department attribute).  Todd doesn't like including Docker in the examples, but does like the way the Docker example changes the requirements with copy_Requirements and set_Requirements.\n</li><li>Put group name in immutable attributes so user can't change it, and to hammer home the point that transforms are applied BEFORE the transaction is committed and thus also BEFORE SUBMIT_REQUIREMENTS are evaluated.\n</li><li>Add map file to user group example (in comments?).\n</li><li>Submit requirements example should require a group.\n</li><li>Maybe put complex examples in recipes section of Wiki.\n</li><li>Make a link <strong>to</strong> this from the accounting groups section.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2016-Dec-05 09:44", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Sep-30 13:34", "fixed_version": "2016-Sep-30 13:34", "broken_version": "v080507", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "#5885", "creator": "tim", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
