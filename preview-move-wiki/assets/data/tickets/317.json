{"id": 317, "title": "Ticket #317: Make CCB work with standard universe", "description": "<blockquote>\nCCB doesn't work at all with standard universe. Why? Because the sockets that the shadow opens to communicate with the starter are created by connecting to the startd. It doesn't connect to the startd's command port (or all would be well). Instead, the startd creates two new listen ports and the shadow connects to those. One solution would be to have the shadow create the connections by connecting (in advance of ACTIVATE_CLAIM) to the startd command port with some kind of command that indicates to the startd that it should just hold on to those connections until ACTIVATE_CLAIM happens. There are other possible solutions, but I think this one would be the simplest.\n\n<p>If that problem were solved, it would be possible to run standard universe jobs on a private execute node from a public submit node. It would still not be possible to run on a public execute node from a private submit node (or with a private checkpoint server). The reason is that the checkpoint is sent to the shadow (or checkpoint server) by creating a new connection, but the shadow and checkpoint server are not daemonCore, so this connection cannot be reversed via CCB.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:20", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Mar-11 14:15", "fixed_version": "2009-Mar-11 14:15", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Std", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "#52", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
