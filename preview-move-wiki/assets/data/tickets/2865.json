{"id": 2865, "title": "Ticket #2865: [Debian] Basic test suite run for native builds", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe Debian build framework can run tests as part of the automated build process. We should provide a formula (ideally a single command) that will run part of the test suite and indicate success or failure, as a basic smoke-test of Condor.\n\n<p>The existing test suite gives us almost everything we need. These issues will probably need to addressed before it's useable by the Debian build system:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Test selection: The set of tests we run in the BaTLab is probably too large and time-consuming. We'll want a shorter list.\n</li><li>Lingering daemons: batch_test.pl leaves a set of daemons running after it completes. We'll want a mode where nothing is left running after the tests complete.\n</li><li>Simple command: It'd be nice if the test suite could run using a simple command, maybe as just a build target.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-May-20 14:35", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Mar-06 15:16", "fixed_version": "2012-Mar-06 15:16", "broken_version": "v070700", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#2058", "creator": "cat", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "jfrey@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
