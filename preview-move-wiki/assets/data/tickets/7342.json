{"id": 7342, "title": "Ticket #7342: Add interactive (console) mode to classad_eval", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor more serious debugging of <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> expressions, it might be nice to have an interactive / console mode for <strong>classad_eval</strong>, probably entered if you specify nothing on the command line.  (Or explicitly; it may be useful to pre-populate the ad with the <strong>-file</strong> option, for instance.  Maybe go interactive whenever there are no expressions are on the command-line?)\n\n<p>The idea of course, is that you type an expression and the evaluated form is spit back out.  It's unclear if the ad should always be printed, be printed only when changing it, or only when explicitly requested.  It seems obvious that full GNU readline(-ish) command-line editing (and history?) should be supported; otherwise, it'll be easier to use the command-line editing supported by your shell in many cases.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Oct-24 16:14", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Oct-24 16:14", "fixed_version": "2019-Oct-24 16:14", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#7339", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu, matyas@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
