For the VM universe, it is not fatal if the executable actually exists - it's just a placeholder.\n\n<p>If using condor-c to condor VM universe, this logic is not invoked.  If you leave out \"executable\" or feed it a placeholder, condor_submit refuses to work.\n\n</p><p>The desired behavior is that if universe = grid and grid_resource = condor* and remote_universe = vm, then the executable should not be required.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2011-Aug-08 13:14", "status": "stalled", "created": "2011-May-16 15:05", "fixed_version": "2011-May-16 15:05", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tstclair", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
