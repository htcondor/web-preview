It just silently fails.  Better would be to notify flightworthy somehow.  Failing that, some sort of validate-create-build-tag-input script would be nice.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 17:27", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Oct-15 13:29", "fixed_version": "2009-Oct-15 13:29", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
