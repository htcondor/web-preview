Mucho gracias!\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Dec-07 13:44:18 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm, Karen just pinged me about this ticket, which is the first I've known about it.  Anyhow, I sent some info to her, but it also looks like submit_event_notes and submit_event_user_notes may not always work right in combination.  Specifically (just from looking at the code, not from testing) it seems like if you write out an event with no submit_event_notes value, but a submit_event_user_notes value, that event won't get read correctly by the event-reading code -- that code assumes that the first thing it hits is submit_event_notes, but if you have only submit_event_user_notes I think that will be interpreted as submit_event_notes.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Dec-07 14:42:35 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nsubmit_event_notes is now documented in the 7.4.4 and future manuals.  Submit command submit_event_user_notes will remain quietly undocumented until it is fixed or determined that it works correctly.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Dec-07 14:41</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"chngview?cn=25814\">[25814]</a></span>: added definition of submit command: submit_event_notes. gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/tickets?ticket=1471\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1471'); return false;\" title=\"submit_event_notes and submit_event_user_notes undocumented\">#1471</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2010-Dec-07 14:42", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Jun-21 13:42", "fixed_version": "2010-Jun-21 13:42", "broken_version": "v070402", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, smoler@cs.wisc.edu, wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
