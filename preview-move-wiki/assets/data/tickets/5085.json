{"id": 5085, "title": "Ticket #5085: Need std::string Sinful::human_friendly() const", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere should be a function, perhaps part of class Sinful, that takes a Sinful and returns something \"human friendly,\" with a particular eye toward terseness.  Sacrifices can be made for the representation; it will lose information and it won't be parseable.  It is <em>not</em> appropriate for log messages where important information for debugging may be lost.  This is just for the convenience of a quick scan by users.\n\n<p>knoeller is implementing a simple version for condor_q; it will just replace everything after the question mark with \"...\".  We at least want to do things like ignoring the primary address/port in favor what we find in addrs if addrs is present. I suggest eliminating the &lt;angle brackets&gt;, as the result isn't really a Sinful.\n\n</p><p>This is for things like condor_q, whose default output used to start with nice short things like\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  -- Submitter: foo.example.com : &lt;192.168.0.55:35706&gt; : foo.example.com\n</pre>\n\n<p>but now can look like (in a fairly complex but not extreme case)\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  -- Submitter: foo.example.com : &lt;192.168.0.55:35706?addrs=192.168.0.55:35706+[fe80::abcd:1234:0001:1010]:35706&amp;sock=collector&amp;PrivAddr=%3c10.0.0.1:35706%3e&amp;PrivNet=ExampleLand&gt; : foo.example.com\n</pre>\n\n<p>and I propose to turn that into something like\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  -- Submitter: foo.example.com : [fe80::abcd:1234:0001:1010]:35706 : foo.example.com</pre>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Jun-08 16:07", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jun-08 16:07", "fixed_version": "2015-Jun-08 16:07", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
