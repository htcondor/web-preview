{"id": 1213, "title": "Ticket #1213: Schedd has bad interaction with NFS", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe schedd has an issue where it'll hang while getting a lock to a DAG log file on NFS. The log file must be moved to a different name, the schedd killed, the log file moved back to the original name, and the schedd restarted to break the hang. Otherwise, the schedd, if simply killed, will start up and get right back into the hanging state, over, and over again. This is most likely due to bad interaction of file locking and NFS.\n\n<p>See ticket for additional details.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nI guss the locking work fixes most (if not all of the issue). Therefore I am going to close this ticket.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Nov-21 15:09:32 by cweiss:</em> <br/>\n\nI dislike putting a \"fixed version\" field here, because no active work was done on this ticket. I will define 7.6.0 as \"fixed version\", simply because that was the first stable version containing the locking changes.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Nov-21 15:10", "status": "defer", "created": "2010-Feb-12 12:54", "fixed_version": "2010-Feb-12 12:54", "broken_version": "v070204", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "cweiss", "derived_from": "#1016", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "a19983", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu, cweiss@cs.wisc.edu, matt@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
