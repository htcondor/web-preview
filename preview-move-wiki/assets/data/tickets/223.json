The default is 6,400 bytes, expressed as \"long maxsize = 6400;\" at line 70 in main() of src/server/broker_master.c.  A 6kB log file is silly, a more reasonable default would be at least 64,000, and probably even larger.\n\n<p>In all likelyhood, the goal was to match Condor's old default of 64,000 bytes (no longer the default).  Tellingly src/common/log.c line 14 defaults Generic_maxlog to 64000, but this limit is never used as it's always overwritten.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Nov-09 16:50:44 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nGCB is dead.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Nov-21 15:58", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Feb-18 13:15", "fixed_version": "2009-Feb-18 13:15", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "GCB", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
