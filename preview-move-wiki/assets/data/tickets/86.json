{"id": 86, "title": "Ticket #86: PrivSep chown operation should be \"best-effort\"", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, the <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> Switchboard&amp;#8217;s recursive chown operation (invoked by the Starter to manage ownership of the job sandbox) fails if it encounters any problems along the way. The result when this happens is that the job fails as well. There are cases, however, when the job could still successfully complete. As one example, a job could create a hard link in its sandbox to a file that it doesn&amp;#8217;t own. Thankfully, the Switchboard will refuse to chown the linked file, but this will also cause the job to fail. It would be fine to simply skip the file and go on in this case; the job would only fail if the linked file needs to be transferred back as output and the condor user does not have read access to it.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:20", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-23 16:40", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-23 16:40", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
