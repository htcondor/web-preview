If it is not set and bridge networking is desired (ie listed in VM_NETWORKING_TYPE) then error messages will be printed and bridge networking will be removed as a valid option for that node.<br/>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nBefore I might document this new configuration variable, I'll need to know what its definition might be.  WHAT must it be set to? Is it a string?  If yes, what strings might be appropriate?  Note that neither this ticket nor the one it was derived from (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1402\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1402'); return false;\" title=\"VM universe: issues with bridged networking\">#1402</a></span>) describe VM_NETWORKING_BRIDGE_INTERFACE.\n\n<p>Don't forget to put a new version history item into the correct branch of the manual, to avoid a fine (as assigned by the wrangler).\n\n</p><p>Once the question is answered and the version history item task is done, I may reassign this ticket to myself and complete this documentation ticket for you.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jun-01 14:52:14 by rrati:</em> <br/>\n\nThe VM_NETWORKING_BRIDGE_INTERFACE is a string value that must be set to the networking interface that VM Universe jobs (xen or kvm only) will use for bridge networking.  The bridge network interface must be set up by the system administrator prior to setting VM_NETWORKING_BRIDGE_INTERFACE.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\nJune 18, 2010 by Karen: <br/>\n\nXEN_BRIDGE_SCRIPT changed last October.  So, it doesn't exist now.\n\n<p>I also put into the correct manual branch proper version history items.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Jun-17 11:19</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/3f1891bfc50e70d723ff0705823e4c21806e8113\">[25544]</a></span>: documented new knob VM_NETWORKING_BRIDGE_INTERFACE and removed (now gone) VM_BRIDGE_SCRIPT; gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1407\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1407'); return false;\" title=\"VM Universe Bridge Params update\">#1407</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2010-Jun-17 11:22", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-May-14 11:41", "fixed_version": "2010-May-14 11:41", "broken_version": "v070403", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "rrati", "derived_from": "", "creator": "rrati", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "smoler@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
