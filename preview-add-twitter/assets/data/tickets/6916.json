{"id": 6916, "title": "Ticket #6916: CREAM update for OpenSSL 1.1.0 causes crashes", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn 8.6.13, we patched the CREAM source code (and its dependencies) so that it would build against OpenSSL 1.1.0. We now have multiple reports that those changes cause the CREAM code to crash on RHEL7 (OpenSSL 1.0.x). We need to either fix or remove the patch.\n\n<p>Since the latest version of the CREAM client library doesn't build against OpenSSL 1.1.0, it seems reasonable to say we won't try to patch it to do so.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Feb-15 11:17</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/57fa46864b116b0c4a724f84d62ef06f7de0a519\">[56196]</a></span>: Disable CREAM support on systems with OpenSSL 1.1.0 or greater. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"review\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6916\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6916'); return false;\" title=\"CREAM update for OpenSSL 1.1.0 causes crashes\">#6916</a></span> The CREAM client library doesn't build with OpenSSL 1.1.0.
