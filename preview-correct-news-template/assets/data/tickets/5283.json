Naturally, since it looked like the problem I was diagnosing was caused by or had a symptom of a daemon hanging, I went to look at what the passed-to side of the conversation was doing.\n\n<p>The passed-to (daemon) side of the conversation creates a named pipe, and then creates a thread in <code>SharedPortEndpoint::StartListener()</code> that blocks in the Windows equivalent of <code>accept()</code>.  This thread writes its process ID back to the pipe (so that the shared port daemon can duplicate the received FD into the daemon's process) and then does some magic to construct the socket.  (Windows sockets aren't just FDs.)  At this point, it grabs a lock, adds the new socket to the list of received sockets, and releases the lock.  (As far as I know, the lock operations are all OK.)\n\n</p><p>It then schedules an immediate timer so that the main daemon core thread will handle the rest of the communication.  It calls <code>Register_Timer_TS()</code> to do so.  (Which grabs a big mutex which I haven't examined.)  This function calls <code>Register_Timer</code>, which calls <code>TimerManager::NewTimer</code>.  <code>TimerManager::NewTimer</code> calls <code>InsertTimer</code>, which calls <code>DaemonCore::Wake_up_select()</code> if the next timer has changed.  (Which it probably has, given that we're registering an immediate timer.)  On Windows, if <code>Wake_up_select()</code> is called from anything other than the main thread, it does nothing.  If the daemon is just waiting around for connections, it may never pick up the phone.\n\n</p><p>On further review, there's a call to <code>Do_Wake_up_select()</code> in <code>Register_Timer_TS()</code>, inside the mutex, which should cause a write to the async pipe to occur.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Sep-30 17:23:22 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nIn test run ID 343215 I added some verbose debugging information to the shared port code.
