This release dynamically links more libraries than before, resulting in a 30 percent decrease in download size on most operating systems.  Please be aware that due to a difference in older condor_master binaries, condor_masters older than 7.7.2, including all 7.6 releases, can not re-exec a 7.7.2 master.  That is, if you try to upgrade a pre-7.7.2 system just by copying over binaries, the condor_master will shutdown, and must be manually restarted.  7.7.2 masters can re-exec themselves without incident.  The Version History  has a list of the major changes.  Condor binaries and source code are available from our Downloads page.</p>

<p>The Condor team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.7.1.  This is the second release in the development series.  This release of Condor now dynamically links the executables to the system security libraries, including openssl.  In the past, these libraries have been statically linked into the binaries.  As a result, system security updates will immediately benefit Condor.  The downside is that binaries built for a given platform may not be as portable to other platforms as in the past.  We have also seen a very rare, intermittent problem with DAGMan where the DAGMan program will ignore a successful job completion, and wait forever.  We hope to resolve this problem in the next development release.  The Version History  has a list of the major changes.  Condor binaries and source code are available  from our Downloads page.</p>

<p>Condor Version 6.3.0 has been released, and is available on the  downloads page. 6.3.0 is the first release in the 6.3 <i>development</i> series. Future 6.3 releases will contain many new features, primarily in the areas of MPI support, Globus support,  firewall support, an improved DAGMan, improved error handling / propagation, and bandwidth regulation.  For more info on our version-number system, please read this. &lt;p&gt; The UNIX builds are now available on the website. The primary focus of 6.3.0 has been in preliminary support for MPI jobs on dedicated clusters of  machines. 6.3.0 is not as well-tested as 6.2.0, and undoubtedly contains a number of bugs. It should not be used by those requiring a tried and tested system; for that we recommend the 6.2 stable series.</p>

<p>The Condor Team announces the release of Condor 7.0.5.  This release contains many bug fixes and some improvements to error handling of Local Universe jobs. Note that some of the bug fixes are security-related; therefore, we recommend sites either upgrade Condor, or restrict permissions on who is allowed to submit Condor jobs to trusted users. Bug fixes that are security related are clearly marked in the Bugs Fixed section of the  Release Notes, with a description of the potential security impact. The Condor Project believes in the full disclosure of information, and therefore    publishes complete vulnerability details. However, in order to give an adequate upgrade window for production installations, we will delay posting the full vulnerability details fixed in this release for 30 days (until the week of November 3rd 2008). In addition, we took just the security bug fixes in v7.0.5 and back-ported them to v6.8; this effort has been released as version 6.8.9. Binaries for both releases, as well as sources for v7.0.5, are available from  our Downloads page.</p>

<p>The Condor Team announces the release of Condor 7.0.5.  This release contains many bug fixes and some improvements to error handling of Local Universe jobs. Note that some of the bug fixes are security-related; therefore, we recommend sites either upgrade Condor, or restrict permissions on who is allowed to submit Condor jobs to trusted users. Bug fixes that are security related are clearly marked in the Bugs Fixed section of the  Release Notes, with a description of the potential security impact. The Condor Project believes in the full disclosure of information, and therefore    publishes complete vulnerability details. However, in order to give an adequate upgrade window for production installations, we will delay posting the full vulnerability details fixed in this release for 30 days (until the week of November 3rd 2008). In addition, we took just the security bug fixes in v7.0.5 and back-ported them to v6.8; this effort has been released as version 6.8.9. Binaries for both releases, as well as sources for v7.0.5, are available from  our Downloads page.</p>

<p>This is the new, stable version of Condor.  It fully supports Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6 on Intel and Sparc platforms, Linux for Intel (libc5 and glibc), SGI IRIX 6.2 through 6.4, Digital Unix 4.0, and HPUX 10.20. You can read about what’s new in this version.  This version only fixes bugs in Condor’s interaction with NIS, and with the benchmarking code that was causing a floating point exception (SIGFPE) on extremely fast machines (like the fastest Alphas).  If you don’t use NIS, or you weren’t having problems with the condor_startd exiting with signal 8, there’s no need to upgrade.</p>
