<P>
As described above, we need to record information from system calls
such as <TT>open()</TT> without any modification of the user code.  We do
this by providing our own version of <TT>open()</TT> which records the
information then calls the system provided <TT>open()</TT> routine.  A
straightforward implementation of this would result in a naming
conflict, i.e. our <TT>open()</TT> routine would cover up the system <TT>
open()</TT> routine.
<P>
The UNIX man pages make a distinction between ``system calls'' and ``C
library routines'' (system calls are described in section 2, and
library routines are described in section 3).  However, from the
programmer's point of view, these two items appear to be very similar.
There may seem to be no fundamental difference between a call to <TT>
write()</TT> and a call to <TT>printf()</TT> - each is simply a procedure call
requesting some service provided by ``the system''.  To see the
difference, consider the plight of a programmer who wants to alter the
functionality of each of these calls, but doesn't want to change their
names.  Keeping the names the same will be crucial if one wants to
link the altered <TT>write()</TT> and <TT>printf()</TT> routines with
existing code which should not be aware of the change.  The programmer
wanting to change <TT>printf()</TT> has at his or her disposal all the
tools and routines available to the original designer of printf, but
the programmer wanting to change <TT>write()</TT> has a problem.  How can
one get the kernel to transfer data to the disk without calling <TT>
write()</TT>?  We cannot call <TT>write()</TT> from within a routine called
<TT>write()</TT> - that would be recursion, and definitely not what is
wanted here.  The solution is a little known routine called <TT>
syscall()</TT>.  Every UNIX system call is associated with a number
(defined by a macro in <code>&lt;syscall.h&gt;</code>).  One can replace an
invocation of a system call with a call to the syscall routine.  In
this case the first argument is the system call number, and the
remaining arguments are just the normal arguments to the system call.
The following <TT>write()</TT> routine simply counts the number of times
<TT>write()</TT> was called in the program, but otherwise acts exactly
like the normal <TT>write()</TT>.
<P>
<PRE>int	number_of_writes = 0;
write( int fd, void *buf, size_t len )
{
	number_of_writes++;
	return syscall( SYS_write, fd, buf, len );
}</PRE>
<P>
Interestingly, this trick works even if the user code never calls <TT>
write()</TT> directly, but only indirectly - for example via <TT>
printf()</TT>.  The condor checkpointing code uses this mechanism to
augment the functionality of a number of system calls.  For example,
we augment the <TT>open()</TT> system call so that it records the name of
the file being opened, and the file descriptor number returned.  This
information is later used to re-open the file at restart time.
