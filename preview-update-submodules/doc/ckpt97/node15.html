Process migration requires that a process can access the same set of
files from different machines.  While this functionality is provided
in many environments via a networked file system, it is often
desirable to share computing resources between machines which don't
have a common filesystem.  For example, we have migrated processes
between our site at the University of Wisconsin, and several sites in
Europe and Russia.  Since these sites certainly do not share a common
file system, condor provides its own means of location independent
file access.  This is done by maintaining a process (called the
``shadow'') on the machine where the job was submitted which acts as
an agent for file access by the migrated process.  All calls to system
routines that use file descriptors by the user's code are re-routed by
RPCs to the shadow.  We do this at the system call level, so that
whether the user code uses <TT>write()</TT> directly, or calls <TT>
printf()</TT> (or even some other routine we've never heard of which
ultimately exercises the <TT>write()</TT> system call), correct action
results.
