<P>
To find all active segments, the checkpoint library uses the <TT>
ioctl()</TT> interface to the <TT>/proc</TT> file system, available on a
number of UNIX variants.  In the <TT>/proc</TT> directory, there is a
file for each running process, named by process-ID, which gives access
to the process's memory contents.  There is an <TT>ioctl()</TT> call to
find the number of mapped memory segments in use by a given process
and another to find information about each segment (virtual start
address, size of segment in bytes, protection and attribute flags).
Note that this call returns all process segments, including stack,
data, and text segments.
<P>
On systems where the <TT>/proc</TT> file system is not available or does
not provide the needed interface, the library could instead record the
needed information at the time of <TT>mmap()</TT> calls.  The <TT>
mmap()</TT> function is used by the dynamic linker to create new segments
and map shared libraries into the segments.  Our method for augmenting
system calls to record needed information is described below in
section <A HREF="node11.html#secsyscalls">3.4.1</A>.  Dynamic library support is currently only
provided on systems which have the needed <TT>/proc</TT> interface.
<P>
Once the segment information is obtained, Condor must determine which
segments are which, because some of the segments must be treated
specially.  The data and text segments are identified by comparing the
addresses to the address of a static function (in the Condor
checkpoint library) and the address of a global variable,
respectively.  The stack segment(s) are identified by comparing the
addresses to the stack pointer value and a system defined constant for
the stack ending address.  All other segments are assumed to contain
dynamic library text or data.
<P>
Once all segments are identified, Condor saves all segments except the
static text segment (because the text can be retrieved from the <TT>
a.out</TT> file at restart).  The <TT>write()</TT> system call is used to
write bytes from addresses in memory to the file.  Note that Condor
saves the dynamic library text in addition to dynamic library data.
There are a number of reasons for doing this.  First, this is a simple
way for Condor to ensure that the library text matches the library
data on restart when migrating to a new machine which may have
different versions of system libraries.  If Condor did not ensure
this, it is possible that library text would look for variables in
incorrect locations.  A second reason is that Condor must ensure that
the library text is mapped back into the same location on restart, so
that dynamic links are still valid.  This behavior negates one of the
benefits of dynamic linking (smaller executables) by increasing the
size of the checkpoint file.  However, we felt that this cost was
acceptable compared to the complexity of comparing library versions on
the checkpoint and restart machines and only moving libraries when
necessary.  It should at least be no worse than static checkpointing.
