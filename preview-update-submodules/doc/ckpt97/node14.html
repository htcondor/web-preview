Now that we've seen some of the details, we can look at the ``big
picture'' of how checkpoint/restart is accomplished.  When our
original process is born, condor code installs a handler for the
checkpointing signal, initializes its data structures, then calls the
user's <TT>main()</TT> routine.  At some arbitrary point during execution
of the user code, the checkpoint signal is delivered invoking the <TT>
checkpoint()</TT> routine.  This routine records information about open
files and our current location on the stack in the data area, writes
the data, shared library, and stack areas into a checkpoint file, then
the process either immediately exits or returns from the signal
handler and continues processing (depending on whether the checkpoint
signal was a <EM>vacate</EM> signal or a <EM>periodic</EM> checkpoint
signal).  At restart time condor executes the same program with a
special set of arguments.  The special arguments cause the <TT>
restart()</TT> routine to be called instead of the user's <TT>main()</TT>.
The <TT>restart()</TT> routine overwrites its own data segment with that
stored in the checkpoint file.  Now it has the list of open files,
signal handlers, etc. in its own data space, and restores those parts
of the state.  Next, it switches its stack to a temporary location in
the data space, and overwrites its own process's stack with that saved
in the checkpoint file.  The <TT>restart()</TT> routine then returns to
the stack location that was current at the time of the <TT>
checkpoint()</TT>, i.e. the <TT>restart()</TT> routine returns to the <TT>
checkpoint()</TT> routine.  Now the <TT>checkpoint()</TT> routine returns,
but recall that this routine is a signal handler - it therefore
returns to the user code that was interrupted by the checkpoint
signal.  The user code resumes from where it left off, and is none the
wiser.
