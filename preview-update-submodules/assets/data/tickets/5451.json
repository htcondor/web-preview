{"id": 5451, "title": "Ticket #5451: Gittrac: Add \"Create derived ticket\" link", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen looking at a ticket, on the line with \"[Attach] [Edit] [History] [Rust]\" there should be \"[Create Derived]\". Clicking it will take you to <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktnew?derived_from=3\">https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktnew?derived_from=3</a> , pre-filling in the \"Derived From\" field with the previous page's ticket number.\n\n<p>Bonus points for copying over Type, Subsystem, Customer Group, and Visibility.\n\n</p><p>Extra bonus points for noticing that the parent's summary has a colon, and copying everything up to and including the colon. So if you derive from \"Ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"active\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5351\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5351'); return false;\" title=\"HTCondor View: replacement for Condor View\">#5351</a></span>: HTCondor View: replacement for Condor View\", the new ticket's summary would be prefilled with \"HTCondor View:\"\n\n</p><p>Purpose, I've used derived tickets heavily for HTCondor View and the IPv6 work, and this is a slightly irritating wrinkle. It's easy to forget to set the derived field and it adds another step. Obviously not a big deal, but it would be nice.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Dec-23 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Dec-23 13:48", "fixed_version": "2015-Dec-23 13:48", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#3", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
