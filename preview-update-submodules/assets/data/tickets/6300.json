We parse the\nEventLog and the extra newline on the Message line caused our parsing\nthe log to fail. I've looked through the release notes for newer\nversions and didn't see a fix include nor could I find an existing\nticket for it. The error was triggered by the compute node\n'p-7-42.local' /var filling up. Let me know if you would like any more\ninformation or if there is anything I can do to help. Here is a sample\nof the event with the formatting issue.\n\n...\n007 (789884.359.000) 06/06 02:55:47 Shadow exception!\n     Error from slot1@p-7-42.local: dprintf hit fatal errors\n\n     0  -  Run Bytes Sent By Job\n     6213  -  Run Bytes Received By Job\n...\n028 (789884.359.000) 06/06 02:55:47 Job ad information event triggered.\n*Message = \"Error from slot1@p-7-42.local: dprintf hit fatal errors**\n**\"*\nSentBytes = 0.0\nMyType = \"ShadowExceptionEvent\"\nReceivedBytes = 6213.0\nTriggerEventTypeNumber = 7\nEventTime = \"2017-06-06T02:55:47\"\nCluster = 789884\nProc = 359\nEventTypeNumber = 28\nSubproc = 0\nTriggerEventTypeName = \"ULOG_SHADOW_EXCEPTION\"\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>As far as I know, we don't actually guarantee that there won't be blank lines in the job log, but seems like it should be easy to fix.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Jun-13 13:49:50 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThis probably doesn't need a release note.
