{"id": 110, "title": "Ticket #110: Change ProcD to run without root privilege", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe ProcD currently requires root privilege for two purposes:\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>To get information about the processes on the system\n</li><li>To send signals\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>These two functions could fairly easily be made <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> switchboard operations, which would allow the ProcD to run without root. This would reduce the size of root-running code in <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> mode by quite a bit, and would let us more safely add additional capabilities to the ProcD (e.g. dprintf logging).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Feb-17 15:47:04 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nNote the work in the ticket is really work to the switchboard, not the procd. Also note that the purpose of doing this ticket isn't so much for increased security, but more so the procd can use bigger (and maybe less secure) libraries like daemoncore and dprintf that would allow us to more easily debug it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Mar-04 10:27:53 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nNote that the above mentioned new switchboard operations should be limited to \"seeing\" or killing processes that are owned by users that Condor has access to, as configured in the Switchboard's configuration file.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Oct-21 09:35:23 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\n<span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4057\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4057'); return false;\" title=\"Remove PrivSep from the HTCondor code base\">#4057</a></span>) and switchboard (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6259\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6259'); return false;\" title=\"Remove condor_root_switchboard from the release\">#6259</a></span>) are gone.
