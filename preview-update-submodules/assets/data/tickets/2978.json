{"id": 2978, "title": "Ticket #2978: Update documentation for 7.6, it has a typo in section 3.13.9.9", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe documentation for v7.6 still refers to the old nomenclature for dynamic slots as being slotx.y instead of slotx_y.  This behavior was changed in version v070402 but the documentation does not reflect the current behavior.  Specifically these two sentences:\n\"The portion of the slot that is utilized is referred to as Slot1.1, and after allocation, the slot advertises that it has the following resources still available:\"\n\"As each new job is allocated to Slot1, it breaks into Slot1.1, Slot1.2, etc., until the entire set of available resources have been consumed by jobs.\"</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-May-14 15:23:18 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nThanks for finding and pointing out this typo.
