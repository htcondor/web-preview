This sounds like a useful thing for condor annexes; and since it would probably be easier to introduce a new command there (they're all new), maybe that'd be the right place to start.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-May-26 14:32", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Mar-24 20:22", "fixed_version": "2016-Mar-24 20:22", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "atlas", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, jhover@bnl.gov", "due_date": ""}
