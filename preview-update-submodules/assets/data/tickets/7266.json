{"id": 7266, "title": "Ticket #7266: Create wiki page for \"Jupyter anchor\" recipe", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe should write a Wiki page based on DESY's configuration for quickly matching Jupyter jobs to dedicated resources, so that we can have a recipe for a \"Jupyter anchor\" node admins could drop into their pools.\n\n<p>(A Docker image or file would be nice, too.)\n\n</p><p>Initially, this recipe will be a central manager and schedd dedicated to Jupyter.  This adds complexity and slowness.  We'd like to switch to a model based on the schedd allowing claim reuse based on accounting group, along with long-term holding of claimed (but idle) slots in order to reserve them for jobs which require fast starts.
