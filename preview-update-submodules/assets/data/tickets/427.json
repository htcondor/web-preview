{"id": 427, "title": "Ticket #427: Make proxy refresh handling consistent in the gridmanager", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe gridmanager's handling of forwarding renewed proxies is very inconsistent across the different grid-types. The handling should be made more consistent.\n\n<p>The different behaviors are outlined here:\n</p><ul>\n<li>In gt2, the proxy is immediately forwarded to a running jobmanager, but a stopped jobmanager will be restarted only if the old proxy has less than 6 hours of life left.\n</li><li>In gt4, the renewed proxy is forwarded if the old proxy has less than 11 hours of life left, and failed attempts are retried at most every 5 minutes.\n</li><li>In cream, the renewed proxy is forwarded immediately, and failed attempts are retried at most every 5 minutes.\n</li><li>In condor, the renewed proxy is forwarded immediately, and the interval between failed attempts is controlled by GRIDMANAGER_PROXY_REFRESH_INTERVAL.\n</li><li>In lsf/pbs, the renewed proxy is forwarded immediately and there's no control of retries on failure.\n</li><li>In nordugrid, there is no forwarding of renewed proxies.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Some difference in behavior may be appropriate between systems where forwarding is done per job (gt2, condor, pbs/lsf) vs per site (gt4, cream). In the latter case, more aggressive forwarding is acceptable.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:20", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Apr-28 15:24", "fixed_version": "2009-Apr-28 15:24", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
