{"id": 648, "title": "Ticket #648: gridmanager busy-loops reading from gahp", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen the gridmanager expects a reply from the gahp server, it sits in a tight loop doing non-blocking reads until the data arrives. With a well-behaved gahp, this should only happen for a few milliseconds. Dan Bradley observed some abnormal cases where the gt2 gahp got stuck in DNS name resolution with an unresponsive server, causing the gahp to not reply to the gridmanager for over a minute.\n\n<p>The gridmanager's busy-loop reads should be replaced with something more intelligent. We may also want to try using the threaded globus libraries in the gt2 gahp.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:19", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jul-31 13:45", "fixed_version": "2009-Jul-31 13:45", "broken_version": "v070200", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
