(This is not the default and should only be enabled if you need it and know what you are doing!)\n\n<p>In that situation, the plugin is invoked with real uid 0 and effective uid of the user doing the transfer.\n\n</p><p>If the plugin uses shared libraries that are specified in the binary's <code>RUNPATH</code> relative to <code>$ORIGIN</code> as opposed to absolute paths, the loader will refuse to load them for security reaons when the uid and euid do not match.\n\n</p><p>There's isn't much HTCondor can do about this other than try to print a helpful message in the log.  The sysadmin has the option of installing the necessary shared libraries in a system location such as <code>/usr/lib[64]/</code>.  Setting <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> doesn't do the trick either.  Check man page for <code>ld.so</code>, although it's fairly lacking.  Search the web for \"ld.so setuid shared library\" or similar.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Sep-06 09:38:02 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW:</strong> Looks good, can only result in a new log message.
