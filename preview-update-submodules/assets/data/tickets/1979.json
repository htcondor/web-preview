{"id": 1979, "title": "Ticket #1979: Installer throws a warning if the firewall service is deactivated.", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe Windows firewall service can be turned off and any attempt by installers to punch holes in it will result in a warning message box popping up.  This is only a problem if the service itself is turned off explicitly.  Turning off the firewall through the control panel does not turn off the service.  This could potentially be a problem during unattended installs and is also likely to confuse end users.  Ignoring the error will allow the installation to complete successfully but the best solution is to find a way to conditionalize the firewall hole punching.\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>Determine if there is a way to detect what services are running on a system.\n</li><li>See if the firewall exception schema can be conditionalized.\n</li><li>Depending on results of previous two efforts, determine best course of action for dealing with unattended installs.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Mar-28 16:30:38 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nSeems one can set the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=FirewallException\" title=\"Firewall Exception\">FirewallException</a></span> to ignore errors silently.
