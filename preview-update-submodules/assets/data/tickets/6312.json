Further, low-prio jobs from other schedds were starting to run: this was starting to ring some alarm bells.\n\n<p>Looking at the problem schedd, I saw lots of negotiation that looked like this (from <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SchedLog\" title=\"Sched Log\">SchedLog</a></span>):\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>06/21/17 03:48:21 (pid:9979) Activity on stashed negotiator socket: &lt;negotiator:1097&gt;\n06/21/17 03:48:21 (pid:9979) Using negotiation protocol: NEGOTIATE\n06/21/17 03:48:21 (pid:9979) Negotiating for owner: production.cmsdataops@cms\n06/21/17 03:48:21 (pid:9979) Negotiating owner=production.cmsdataops@cms jobprio restricted, min=900000 max=900000\n06/21/17 03:48:21 (pid:9979) Checking consistency running and runnable jobs\n06/21/17 03:48:21 (pid:9979) Tables are consistent\n06/21/17 03:48:21 (pid:9979) Rebuilt prioritized runnable job list in 0.040s.\n06/21/17 03:48:22 (pid:9979) Finished negotiating for production.cmsdataops in local pool: 0 matched, 16 rejected\n06/21/17 03:48:22 (pid:9979) Activity on stashed negotiator socket: &lt;negotiator:1097&gt;\n06/21/17 03:48:22 (pid:9979) Negotiator command was 425 (not NEGOTIATE_WITH_SIGATTRS or NEGOTIATE) --- aborting\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>From the negotiator side, it would try to negotiate for prio 900k jobs -- succeed but produce no matches -- then negotiate for prio 600k jobs from the same user.  However, when done with prio 600k, it would get a generic socket failure.\n\n</p><p>It seems like the schedd and negotiator disagree where they are in the protocol.  Command # 425 from the negotiator is\n<code>END_NEGOTIATE</code>, but schedd thought it already finished negotiating.\n\n</p><p>It seemed to be blocking the prio 600k jobs so I did a qedit of all the stuck workflows to set <code><span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobPrio\" title=\"Job Prio\">JobPrio</a></span> = 900000</code>: they immediately started running, again pointing to a negotiation problem.\n\n</p><p>My working theory is there is a problem in the negotiator when prefetching is enabled and global job prios are used, causing it to send the <code>END_NEGOTIATE</code> command twice.\n\n</p><p>Looking through the Negotiator logs for socket write failures, it seems to occur with every busy schedd.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Jun-21 16:40:59 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nMy simple attempts to reproduce this error have been unsuccessful.\n\n<p>The logs indicate that the schedd considered the negotiation over without receiving an END_NEGOTIATE command (otherwise, it would log \"Lost priority - X jobs matched\"). It only does this if it receives SEND_JOB_INFO or SEND_RESOURCE_REQUEST_LIST and immediately responds with NO_MORE_JOBS.\nThis implies that prefetch didn't get all of the request ads. The negotiator asked for more during the regular cycle, and after it got them all, sent a superfluous END_NEGOTIATE.\n\n</p><p>I've yet to find a way to trigger that set of events.

It can be triggered when there are multiple request ads for the some autocluster, due to interleaving job priorities. When prefetch gets all of the request ads and the last ad is in the same autocluster as a previous ad that didn't get matched, the negotiator sends an extra SEND_RESOURCE_REQUEST_LIST (which won't return any new ads) followed an unnecessary END_NEGOTIATE (which the schedd isn't expecting).\n\n<p>In <code>ResourceRequestList::getRequest()</code>, if the boolean <code>m_send_end_negotiate</code> is true, then prefetch saw a NO_MORE_JOBS from the schedd and the negotiator shouldn't try to fetch any more request ads. The function should return false immediately if there are no more ads (<code>cached_resource_request</code> is exhausted and <code>m_ads</code> is empty). We check this once before trying to pull another ad from <code>m_ads</code>. But if the remaining ads in <code>m_ads</code> are in autoclusters that have already been exhausted, the function ends up querying the schedd for more ads when it shouldn't. If the schedd responds with NO_MORE_JOBS (the usual case), it will consider the negotiation complete. But the calling function in the negotiator thinks it still needs to send an END_NEGOTIATE.\n\n</p><p>The check of <code>m_send_end_negotiate</code> needs to move inside the while loop looking to populate <code>front</code>.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Jul-03 09:18:01 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nGreat detective work!\n\n<p>Can I request a backport to the stable series also?  While not essential for CMS, I think it sounds like other users of prefetching might also trigger this problem.\n\n</p><p>If this clears out all the prefetch errors, then maybe (in a separate ticket) we should consider turning it on by default.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Jul-31 15:08:52 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE_REVIEW</strong> change looks good.
