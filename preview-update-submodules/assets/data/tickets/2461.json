At this point, if transfer_files is set to ONEXIT (the default) in the job's submit description file, the job switches from states, from Running to Idle, and no files are transferred back. If transfer_files is set to ALWAYS, then any files in the job's temporary working directory which were changed or modified are first sent back to the submitting machine....\"\n\n</p><p>I think the description here of \"transfer_files\" is old and by now incorrect, isn't it?\nThe parameter \"transfer_files\" seems not to exist anymore....\nInstead I believe the following substitutions in the above text should be done:\n\n</p><p>transfer_files --- when_to_transfer_output\nONEXIT --- ON_EXIT\nALWAYS --- ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT\n\n</p><p>If so, then please fix the manual.\n\n</p><p>Regards,\nRob.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Sep-13 13:28:09 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nIn fact, the entire section needs a bit of editing.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Sep-13 13:29</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/bd3567af8af25abf5c77c72d66ad081dde73207f\">[27192]</a></span>: Windows-specific subsection on how Condor starts and stops jobs had errors and needed a bit of editing. ===GT:Fixed=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2461\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2461'); return false;\" title=\"section 6.2.8 (Windows platform-specific info) needs correction\">#2461</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2011-Oct-19 10:24", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Sep-13 13:27", "fixed_version": "2011-Sep-13 13:27", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
