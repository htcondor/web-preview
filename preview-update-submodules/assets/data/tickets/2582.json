{"id": 2582, "title": "Ticket #2582: Document QUEUE_SUPER_USERS macro", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe QUEUE_SUPER_USERS macro is not defined in the manual from what I can see.  It should be discussed in the security section.\n\n<p>In the documentation about WRITE level authorization in the schedd, the following is mentioned:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nThe commands which write information into the job queue (such as condor_submit and condor_hold). Note that for most commands which attempt to write to the job queue, Condor will perform an additional user-level authentication step. This additional user-level authentication prevents, for example, an ordinary user from removing a different user's jobs.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>I believe this is referring to the QUEUE_SUPER_USERS mechanism, but I can't find a clear description anywhere else.\n\n</p><p>I would note that the QUEUE_SUPER_USERS mechanism is completely unlike the rest of the authorization mechanisms - it's based on the user name, not the domain name or the originating address.  This breaks the security scheme at our site, where we make a distinction between daemons (foo@daemon.unl.edu) and site users (username@unl.edu).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2011-Oct-25 10:52", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Oct-25 10:52", "fixed_version": "2011-Oct-25 10:52", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
