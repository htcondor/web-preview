{"id": 1208, "title": "Ticket #1208: Dataflow with Files using Dagman", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis ticket sketches a description of a possible enhancement to the\nDAGMan functionality.\n\n<p>The enhancement is that if you have two nodes in this relationship A-&gt;B,\nwhen node A produces, and completes, a file Af that B solely requires\nto run, then B may immediately start, even though A is still running\npossibly producing other files for other nodes.  This mimics much\nmore of a dataflow dependency instead of a job completion dependency.\nAdditionally, when Af is noticed and moved to where ever it needs to go\nso B can run, an event is written into the event log associated with the\nnode such that we don't try to move the file again in other circumstances.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Milestones </h2>\nThe branch holding this work is <strong>V7_5-dataflow-2-branch</strong>.\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li><strong>[condor_starter change]</strong>: Periodically bring closed output files back to spool <strong>[DONE]</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Implement a means to get the open files of a running process. <strong>[DONE]</strong>\n</li><li>Implement: user turns on dataflow semantics with jobad attr, timer in starter to perform checks. <code>transfer-dataflow-output-files</code> <strong>[DONE enough]</strong>\n</li><li>Modify the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=FileTransfer\" title=\"File Transfer\">FileTransfer</a></span> object to:\n<ol>\n<li>Get all pids for job's process tree and get list of open files. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1515\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1515'); return false;\" title=\"Add open files to ProcAPI::getProcInfo &amp; condor_procd\">#1515</a></span> <strong>[DONE]</strong>\n</li><li>Using the filetransfer api, get the list: <div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">(filter (closed-file-in-pids-p job-pids)\n (filter output-file-p\n  (enumerate-sandbox-files job-pids)))\n</pre></div>\n\n</li><li>Transfer that list back as if ON_EVICT_OR_EXIT. <strong>[DONE]</strong>\n</li></ol>\n</li></ol>\n\n<p></p></li><li><strong>[file-transfer object change]</strong>: Make it so closed dataflow files\nare only brought back ONCE. Currently, even though the dataflow file is\nclosed, it is brought back multiple times. If the file is repoened and\nclosed again, maybe it can be brought back again (which would actually\nviolate our assumptions so it needs to be seriously considered), but\nalso only ONCE until the next time. This should be implemented by augmenting\nthe file atalog to allow dynamic insertion of files into it after it has been\ncreated. I also need to check at final upload time that if there are dataflow\nfiles in the file catalog to NOT transfer them.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Assumptions </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The files that are to be created by an executing node and used in the\ndataflow <strong>must</strong> have these semantics. This is more restrictive than how the\nfiletransfer object decides a file is considered an output file or an intermediate file.\n<ol>\n<li>The created file must not exist in the sandbox manifest.\n</li><li>The file is <strong>atomically</strong> created and opened for use, <strong>once</strong>.\n</li><li>Once the file is closed, it <strong>stays closed</strong>.\n</li></ol>\n</li><li>There is a way on Linux/Unix to determine the open files a process is using.\n</li><li>Condor knows a manifest of the sandbox, to determine when these files are\npresent.\n</li><li>There is a means by which the files can be moved asynchronously out of the\njob execution directory while the job is still running.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Feasibility </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Determination of open files by a process on Linux.\n<ul>\n<li>If one looks in the directory /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd you will find a list of fds\nopened by the process and the files to which they point. Using the command\n<code>stat</code> we can see that the read/write status of the fd is available for that\nfile. This information is thusly available.\n</li><li>If one knows the manifest of the sandbox, then any file added to the\nsandbox that is not referenced by an open fd would be considered a candidate\nfor execution interleaving of a future node.\n</li><li>Feasible to find files in the correct state on Linux: <strong>YES</strong>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Condor today knows the sandbox manifest.\n</li><li>Condor would need functionality to implement asynchronous file transfer\nwhile job is still running.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Problems </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Idempotency of output files under retry/eviction/crash conditions.\nIn this scenario:\n<ol>\n<li>job A starts up\n</li><li>file Af is produced.\n</li><li>file Af is asynchronously transfered back and committed.\n</li><li>execute node crashes/evicts/etc/fails.\n</li><li>Job A restarts (also could with <strong>RETRY</strong>) on potentially different node.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>What will happen is file Af will appear as an input file in the sandbox\nwhen the job restarts. If the job is unware of the previous state it had\nwritten, it will regenerate Af, as which point the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=FileTransfer\" title=\"File Transfer\">FileTransfer</a></span> object\nwill see it as an output file, and transfer it back again--overwriting\nthe first transfer, causing a duplicate dataflow message, and making\nthe entire dataflow possibly inconsistent unless care is taken. If the\njob is aware of the previous state and does not regenerate Af, then Af\nwill never be transferred back and all is well.\n\n</p><p></p></li><li>Dataflow connections between nodes do not have infinite capacity to store\ntokens. Example: if in the dataflow <code>A-&gt;B</code>, B consumes data tokens at a slower rate than A produces them, we would run out of disk space. So, when we're getting close to our allotment of space denoted for that specific stream, how do we signal A to stop? Suspend the process? other?\n\n<p></p></li><li>If a job creates large temporary files, closes them, and reads them as for a table lookup or something similar, then they could be incorrectly flagged as a dataflow file (if the program opens and closes it now and then, but only reads it) and moved back, potentially causing space issues on the submit node or network bandwidth issues. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This can be fixed by allowing the user to specify\nvia regex a list of files that should be considered to have dataflow\nsemantics.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Real world Jobs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Some real world jobs don't fall under workflow model.\n<ul>\n<li>Jobs which do things like:\n<ol>\n<li>compute result\n</li><li>open file with append\n</li><li>write result\n</li><li>close file\n</li><li>repeat\n</li></ol>\n</li><li>Jobs which overwrite their previous output files on restart.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p></li><li>Real world examples of jobs that could benefit\n<ul>\n<li>Craig Struble had a workflow where an image generation phase of\nN processes generated N images (where N is 200,000 or so) and then\nan accumulation phase summed the image into a single image. His main\nproblem was that if you rendered workflow this as a DAG, you'd need\nstorage space for 200,000 images--which were individually large and\nhe didn't have that much space. Since DAGMan can't run a job until all\nof their parents complete, we are <strong>forced</strong> to store all 200,000 images\nbefore the accumulator process is run.\n\n<p>The solution we came up with was there is a DAG producing the\nN images and the space needed for returning images is controlled by\nDAG throttling. Then, the post scripts on the image nodes copy the\nresultant image into a directory using unix rename()--which is atomic,\nwhere a seperate scheduler universe process is polling every X seconds\nand accumulating the partial results into the final image. When the DAG\nfinishes, the final node writes a 'done' messge into the directory which\ncompletes the dataflow.\n\n</p><p>This real world job is the exact type of dataflow job that the\nfeature of this ticket could solve.\n</p></li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>References </h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/index.shtml\">Flow Based Programming</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/book.pdf\">Flow Based Programming - Book</a>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1013209&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=79152560&amp;CFTOKEN=19491160\">Advances in Dataflow Programming Languages</a> - This is particularly good.\n</li><li><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://rainbow.polytech.unice.fr/publis/montagnat-isnard-etal:2009.pdf\">A data-driven workflow language for grids based on array programming principles</a> - Interesting.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Feb-17 11:16:30 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThis ticket has no dated milestones yet since I am in discussion with Miron about the scope of the initial milestone.
