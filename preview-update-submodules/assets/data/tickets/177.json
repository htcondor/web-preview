How annoying.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-27 16:31:15 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nFinally, a breakthough. There is a ''ticket'' field in the initial request structures which is hardcoded to 1637102411. I can use that to disambiguate\nwhich packets are which.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-28 16:08:43 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThe main problem really arises because the u_lint typedef is an unsigned long, which is 32-bit on some platforms and 64 on others. However, there is more horror to behold. It seems there are two header files which define the same stuff, typedef2.h and server_typedefs.h. They have different definitions for u_lint, the former being unsigned long, and the latter being unsigned int. This makes it appear that part of the codebase gets one definition, and part of the codebase gets the other definition. This makes me weep, since now I have to disentangle this as well so I can understand how it'll impact the changes I need to make.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-06 11:57:32 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm having blood flecked foaming at the mouth due to my rage at the checkpoint server code.... how did this thing <strong>ever</strong> work?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-13 15:47:18 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, it seems I have the service_req_pkt being somewhat correctly decoded. Once I get the protocol handling the service port totally and completely finished with regards to the 32/64 bit compatibility codes. The other protocols will be MUCH easier to write and test.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-14 15:13:21 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThe SERVICE protocol in a 32-bit client/server pair coarsely works. I'm testing it now and stumbling over some detritus Sonny left in the codes in addition to some old nasty crap that various developers presumably discovered and then forcibly forgot about suddenly thereafter.\n\n<p>I figured out the \"Weird 0xaabbccdd\" message in the shadow logs... Lose 1d8 SAN.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-18 12:55:09 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nSo, after an afternoon of debugging, it appears that on 64-bit clients, the ticket field, which is a 64 bit quantity, is encoded with htonl(). htonl() is <strong>defined</strong> to only work on 32-bit quantities, so, this means that for 64 bit values, only the low oerder 32 bits are actually changed to network order and back again on the other side.\n\n<p>This screwed me up since I had written a real 64 bit host-&gt;network and back again translator (and there are multiple \"standards\"--which I had thought I screwed up in implementing), and then wondered why it was not producing what I needed.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-19 12:09:01 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I figured <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/82537eec7f910f6274e50258f8018a10a01931b7\">[14706]</a></span> out. There was a math error on the pointer where I was putting the data I was reading off of the net.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-19 16:46:59 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, the service protocol is as good as it used to be. Onward to the store and restore protocols. When those work, then I can cross test.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-20 16:38:51 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, the STORE protocol is tentatively done. I need to test it on 32 and 64 bit platforms independently before I can continue though.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-21 16:29:45 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI coded the RESTORE protocol API, but haven't integrated it into server2.cpp yet.\n\n<p>Once I do, then I have to inspect some tiny little protocol places when the checkpoints are actually being transferred, but I don't think it'll be a problem.\n\n</p><p>After that, cross compatibility testing... almost there.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-28 11:06:29 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, the STORE, RESTORE, and SERVICE protocol packets are done. I did find that the sub-action of SERVICE:CKPT_SERVER_SERVICE_STATUS will send a file_state_info structure raw on the wire to the client. However, I don't think there is any means by which that code path may execute in the current Condor codebase.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-May-28 11:50:21 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n<p>I have seen this matrix work in an autodetecting fashion:\n\n</p><p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<pre>\n             </pre>\n</td>\n<td>\nCkpt Server 32 bit</td>\n<td>\nCkpt Server 64 bit</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nClient 32 bit</td>\n<td>\n YES             </td>\n<td>\n YES             </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nClient 64 bit</td>\n<td>\n YES             </td>\n<td>\n YES             </td>\n</tr>\n\n</tbody></table>\n</p><p>One important thing left for me to do is to warn when a 32 bit ckpt server gets a file size for a 64 bit checkpoint that is larger than it can deal with.

I have two things to do: A) valgrind it on 64 and 32 bit machines and B) have a lucky person code review a +2000 line and -300 line diff. :)\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-01 13:40:06 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I valgrinded the executables both on x86 and x86_64 and both under the permutations that matter. I fixed the couple of minor things it found already.\nI just have to write a largish comment at the start of protocol.cpp, check it in, and this can go for review.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-01 15:50:47 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI wrote the comment.

A call can return success with a partial read if the client closes the connection early. Unlikely, especially for a legit client, but it would be good to add a check.\n\n<p></p></li><li>If gcc's padding in structs has changed as you say, then why isn't the client-side code affected?\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>I give a thumbs-up to merging the branch into V7_2-branch.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-10 12:00:55 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThe first one I'll fix before merging.\n\n<p>As for the second one:\n\n</p><p>It may have been in the past. I don't know. :) It'll take too much time to figure out. I do know that at least on sparc it changed around gcc 3.4. If the structure padding was changed but the site upgraded the checkpoint server in addition to the binaries, the site would never know.\n\n</p><p>As it stands now, the client code <strong>would</strong> be affected if the structure padding changed on linux.\n\n</p><p>I'd much rather fix the client side code base as well to pack the crap into the byte array for the packet. This would disassociate the structure alignment from the packet layout all together and we'd never have to worry about it again. Doing that however, might be a little work since it would be a bit of code juggling to get the client library to contain the structure packing interface so both the ckpt server and client could use it.\n\n</p><p>However, even if it does change on linux, we have a means in the server codes to deal with it so again only the server would have to be upgraded.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-10 14:09:36 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nDid the code changes recommended by Jamie.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-10 15:53:41 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nTested my code changes.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jun-10 15:54:58 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI am complete with this work.\n\n<p>The V7_2-fixckptprot-branch branch has been merged into the V7_2-branch.\n\n</p><p>I have completed and committed the version history entry for this fix.\n\n</p><p>This ticket is resolved.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Jun-10 15:52</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/fe8e380d7f4485131ff8a512cd2c3da7d1ba81a1\">[24843]</a></span>: Documented checkpoint server fix detailed in gittrac ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=177\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('177'); return false;\" title=\"Incompatibility between 32/64bit Ckpt Server and Shadow\">#177</a></span>.
