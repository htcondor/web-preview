I do not check the same conditions that the existing test did. The Ornithology test makes assertions about <code>max_idle</code> and <code>max_materialize</code> (that they are never exceeded, and that the limit is reached at some point during the test, in both cases). The old test is somewhat different:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">if peak_idle &lt; int(sub['max_idle']):\n\tUtils.Log(\"FAILURE: peak_idle({0}) &lt; max_idle({1})\".format(peak_idle, sub['max_idle']))\n\tretval = 1\nelif peak_idle &gt; 2*int(sub['max_idle']):\n\tUtils.Log(\"FAILURE: peak_idle({0}) &gt; 2*max_idle({1})\".format(peak_idle, sub['max_idle']))\n\tretval = 1\nelif total_materialized != num_items:\n\tUtils.Log(\"FAILURE: total_materialized({0}) != {1}\".format(total_materialized, num_items))\n\tretval = 1\nelif total_exited != num_items:\n\tUtils.Log(\"FAILURE: total_exited({0}) != {1}\".format(total_exited, num_items))\n\tretval = 1\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>TJ, could you comment on exactly what assertions you'd like to make / be able to make in the final form of this test?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Sep-08 16:30:14 by karpel:</em> <br/>\n\nFixed an internal bug with log reading that was causing the failure and re-enabled.
