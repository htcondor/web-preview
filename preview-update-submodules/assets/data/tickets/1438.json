{"id": 1438, "title": "Ticket #1438: Addition of skip_filechecks to condor_submit language", "description": "<blockquote>\nskip_filechecks provides the writer of a submit file control over the checks condor_submit will perform on files, such as input and output. It allows fine-grain control that was previously only available in configuration via SUBMIT_SKIP_FILECHECKS or on the command line via condor_submit's -disable flag. For example, if it is desirable to have condor_submit verify the existence of input files for only one job the following can be done,\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>executable = EXE\ninput = input_that_must_already_exist\nqueue\nskip_filechecks = true\ninput = input_that_will_exist\nqueue\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This is also useful for users of DAGMan, where it is not possible to tell DAGMan to pass -disable to condor_submit and disabling all filechecks via SUBMIT_SKIP_FILECHECKS is either infeasible or undesirable.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:08:44 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-01 11:25:24 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nJust discovered this ticket, and I realize that there was a documentation task to have been done in 2010, but there's no Fixed Version field.\n\n<p>I'll correct the lack of documentation for this ticket, but I need to know possible values for this submit command.

Dan answered the question:  which files are all input (checked for read permission) and output files (checked for write permission), such as those set with <strong>input</strong>, <strong>output</strong>, <strong>transfer_input_files</strong>, <strong>transfer_output_files</strong>, as well as a log file set with <strong>log</strong>, and probably the executable, when it is added to the list of input files.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Jul-21 14:54</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/0ab1cb15491aea49fe6dce4a3a3d3431c69028fc\">[26074]</a></span>: documented submit command skip_filechecks, as well as updated corresponding -disable option for condor_submit and SUBMIT_SKIP_FILECHECKS knob ===GT:Fixed=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1438\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1438'); return false;\" title=\"Addition of skip_filechecks to condor_submit language\">#1438</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2011-Jul-21 14:56", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Jun-08 19:30", "fixed_version": "2010-Jun-08 19:30", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "#1437", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu,smoler@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
