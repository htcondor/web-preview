{"id": 1113, "title": "Ticket #1113: DAGMan log file optimization", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor the default log file, just monitor it once at the beginning, keep it monitored for the life of the DAG, and unmonitor it at the end, as opposed to monitoring it and unmonitoring it as nodes are submitted.  I think this could be a good performance gain.\n\n<p>Also have an option (either a config macro or command-line flag) to <strong>not</strong> unmonitor log files -- the user could set this if they know they have a pretty small set of log files, and it would increase performance.\n\n</p><p>(I need to test this out, but I think that re-monitoring a previously-monitored log file is pretty slow.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nI just did some more testing of this, and it seems that unmonitoring and re-monitoring the log files is not a significant performance problem, so I'm going to resolve this ticket without actually changing the code.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Mar-04 18:36", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Jan-15 13:46", "fixed_version": "2010-Jan-15 13:46", "broken_version": "v070401", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
