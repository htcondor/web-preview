The current situation is surprising.\n\n</p><p>This is all a side effect of the absolute-or-relative resolution happening at condor_submit time.\n\n</p><p>Proposal 1: delay the absolute-or-relative resolution until the last possible moment, just before the condor_startd/starter needs it.  At this point $$WHATEVER is known and can be expanded, and the resulting expanded Cmd tested for absoluteness. If it's a relative path, prepend Iwd (already in the job ad) to it.\n\n</p><p>Complications: not all paths go via the startd/starter.  The grid and schedule universes are the most obvious examples.  They would either need to be taught to handle Iwd themselves, or condor_submit would need to conditionally do absolute-or-relative resolution.\n\n</p><p>Proposal 2: If Executable contains \"$$\", defer expansion until \"later\". Pretty much all of the work in Proposal 1 still needs to be done, but for the default case where there is no $$ in the submit file nothing changes nor needs to change.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Oct-02 08:38:01 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nFor (1) the job_router should be considered, e.g. jobs that aren't submitted to the grid uni but end up in it. (2) sounds fairly reasonable. Maybe (1) is ok and it can be stated that this feature only works when Condor is the entire pipe from user to exec node.\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-02 06:13", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jun-16 16:20", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-16 16:20", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "a19394", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
