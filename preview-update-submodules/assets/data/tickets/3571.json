HTCondor treats this as a job disconnect and reschedules the job.\n\n</p><p>In the latest code, I think the relevant variable is NOT_RESPONDING_TIMEOUT - which defaults to 60s.\n\n</p><p>So, transfer plugins only work if all the files are staged out in less than 60s.\n\n</p><p>This is possibly a side-effect of Dan's work with the file transfer object.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Apr-11 09:26:39 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nMy work with the file transfer object shouldn't have changed behavior of file transfer plugins.\n\n<p>I did recently touch the NOT_RESPONDING_TIMEOUT code in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3510\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3510'); return false;\" title=\"synchronized CHILDALIVEs may get dropped by the master\">#3510</a></span>.  The default is certainly not intended to be 60s, and a quick reading of the code implies that it is 3600s.

I don't see anything that does anything special to avoid NOT_RESPONDING_TIMEOUT from firing during the transfer.  I think it has always been like this.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-12 07:08:38 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nThere's still something funky going on here - I still get a lot of disconnect errors, although the job goes on hold.\n\n<p>If a file transfer fails, it goes on hold without a hold reason:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>-- Submitter: hcc-briantest.unl.edu : &lt;129.93.244.208:60784&gt; : hcc-briantest.unl.edu\n ID      OWNER          HELD_SINCE  HOLD_REASON\n 711.0   bbockelm        4/11 21:58 undefined\n 712.0   bbockelm        4/11 21:54 undefined\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>If I look at the logs, the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ShadowLog\" title=\"Shadow Log\">ShadowLog</a></span> indicates there is a problem sending the hold message to the Schedd.
