{"id": 6244, "title": "Ticket #6244: Build python bindings for MacOSX", "description": "<blockquote>\nTony Tiradani would really like to use the python bindings in the MacOSX tarball.\n\n<p><strong>Python Versions</strong>\n\n</p><p>Our cmake scripts currently require that the versions of the python library and interpreter match exactly. Otherwise, we disable the python bindings when building. On our MacOSX build machines, the versions that come with the OS are slightly different (2.7.6 library and 2.7.10 interpreter). If we don't set <code>PythonInterp_FIND_VERSION_EXACT</code> in cmake, then the <code>PythonInterp</code> module will accept an older library and newer interpreter (as long they're still the same major version). We should allow this looser matching of versions.\n\n</p><p>Our build machines also have an older version of python under /usr/local/bin, which comes earlier in the PATH. We're planning to remove that copy, so that /usr/bin/python is used.\n\n</p><p><strong>Plugins</strong>\n\n</p><p>The build fails on the python collector plugin, because <code>CollectorPlugin::CollectorPlugin</code> and <code>CollectorPlugin::~CollectorPlugin</code> can't be resolved at link time. These class methods are defined in <code>CollectorPluginManager.cpp</code>, which ends up in a library named <code>libcollectorlib.a</code>. This library isn't distributed, and is only used to link the <code>condor_collector</code> executable.\n\n</p><p>One solution is to move the definitions of these methods into the class declaration in <code>CollectorPlugin.h</code>. The same may need to be done for other plugin types.\n\n</p><p><strong>Library Paths</strong>\n\n</p><p>In MacOSX, shared libraries contain the path where they can be found at runtime. This can be an absolute path or a path relative to the executable loading the library. This can be set at link time with the -install_name flag. When an executable or shared library is linked, the install_names of the shared libraries it depends on are saved in the new executable/library. These values are used at runtime to find the libraries. Additional search locations for libraries can be provided at runtime via the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.\n\n</p><p>A library's install_name and the install_names of dependent libraries can be queried with <code>otool -L</code>. These values can be modified in existing executables and libraries with <code>install_name_tool</code>.\n\n</p><p>When building HTCondor executables and libraries, we include cmake rules to rewrite the dependent library install_names to be relative paths appropriate for the file layout in the tarball. In the NMI build scripts, we set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH so that we can run the executables, including unit tests, without having to assemble everything with <code>make install</code> first.\n\n</p><p>This setup breaks with the python unit tests. The python interpreter in /usr/bin is covered by SIP, which protects OS programs from potential malicious abuse. This includes removing DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH from the environment. Thus, the python bindings can't find their libraries. Running a shell script that runs a binary in the build tree would similarly fail (unless the script itself set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH).\n\n</p><p>The best fix for this (for both NMI and interactive builds) is to change how we set library install_names. For executables and libraries residing in the build tree, the library install_names should be the full paths to the library files. During the install step, the executable and library files in <code>release_dir</code> should be rewritten so that the library install_names have the appropriate relative paths.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Jun-19 15:55:35 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong>: Looks good.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Jul-21 13:34</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/2018f9e529b85686a8e0635dbb1aef72bcbadbc2\">[51898]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6343\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6343'); return false;\" title=\"Collector Python plugin has undefined symbols\">#6343</a></span>) This breaks collector plugins for OSG Revert \"Move <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CollectorPlugin\" title=\"Collector Plugin\">CollectorPlugin</a></span> constructor/destructor into header file. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6244\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6244'); return false;\" title=\"Build python bindings for MacOSX\">#6244</a></span>\" This reverts commit ba80c01a440f793a49c731efc541fda3d59af831.
