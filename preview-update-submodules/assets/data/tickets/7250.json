In particular, I assume that we always want to copy the file (files?) into the scratch directory.

Creating a <code>gwdata://</code> plugin is fairly straightforward. My understanding is we want this plugin to look for input files locally on the worker nodes? Where exactly are we looking for these files? (I'm assuming not in the spool/execute folders because these get removed after job completion). If somebody on the LIGO side can explain the logic for this that would be very helpful.\n\n<p>As for a fallback when the file doesn't exist locally: this is much trickier. Falling back to our regular file transfer is horribly complicated and not realistic. Greg suggested using <code>condor_chirp</code>; this is a possibility but very fickle and difficult to configure correctly. Is there another way we can grab the full files in a fallback scenario? Are they available on a shared file system? Available by HTTP or some other protocol? Depending on our options here, I may break this functionality off into a separate ticket.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Dec-03 10:06:20 by anderson:</em> <br/>\n\nWorking design doc from LIGO at <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_nXWH64XN4igjYBg_5-6b0Gl7BLB23ml-X9SfQOYlSI/edit\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_nXWH64XN4igjYBg_5-6b0Gl7BLB23ml-X9SfQOYlSI/edit</a>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Dec-03 10:07:55 by anderson:</em> <br/>\n\nFeedback from Mark Coatsworth on design doc,\n\n<p></p><div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nHi Stuart, thanks for the design doc! This helps explain a lot.\n\nOne important detail: the document doesn't describe how files actually get transferred from whatever the GW data source (datafind server?) GW is using. Brian mentioned there's a utility script you use to retrieve data, and the document does mention \"gwpy\" at one point. Is this relevant? If not, can you describe how GW data actually gets retrieved?\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Mar-03 10:29:05 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nThe ball is in Mark's court to provide a plugin API and user-centric example / use-case for LIGO to approve.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Mar-10 10:08:13 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\ngwdatafind source is here: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://git.ligo.org/gwdatafind/gwdatafind\">https://git.ligo.org/gwdatafind/gwdatafind</a>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Mar-23 20:56:37 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm just tidying up the first version of this plugin.
