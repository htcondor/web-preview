The first job to perform the OFFER will get the address and everyone else will get a NACK.\n\n</p><p>Right now, this should simply cause a starter failure and the job will be retried later.  Mike says this is not always so; this should be investigated.\n\n</p><p>Ideally, we should implement more of the DHCP protocol's retry mechanisms in the code.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-25 08:39", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jan-25 08:39", "fixed_version": "2013-Jan-25 08:39", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "bbockelm", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "lark", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
