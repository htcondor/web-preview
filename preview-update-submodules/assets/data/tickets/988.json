We could simply replace a reference to <code>P1</code> on the right-hand side of the definition of <code>P</code> with the definition of <code>P1</code>.  In simple cases, such as the one above, this would be a literal value.  In more complex cases, it would be an expression.

Keep in mind that a user may have thousand of daemons running at once.\n</li><li>The new system should be so fast and convenient that other code might call into it repeatedly instead of calling it and keeping a local copy.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p></li><li>Probably longer term work than the immediate task, but once the new system in place: new code should strongly prefer to call into the param system every time it needs a value, even if it's repeatedly.  The new code should avoid caching the output.  Old code should be slowly transitioned to doing so.  This should reduce memory usage by a bit but more importantly it will reduce the cases where condor_reconfig doesn't work.\n\n<p></p></li><li>This is implied by the description but to be clear something like this would be nice: Given this input file\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">ENABLE_HISTORY_ROTATION, boolean, TRUE\nMAX_HISTORY_LOG, int, 20971520\n</pre></div>\n\nYou will end up with an interface like so:\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">bool options.enable_history_rotation.value();\nbool options.enable_history_rotation.value(const environment &amp; e);\nint options.max_history_log.value();\nint options.max_history_log.value(const environment &amp; e);\n</pre></div>\n\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-17 14:16:19 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nSome attributes in the current config system are treated very specially.\nThey are found in condor_config.cpp:reinsert_specials()\n\n<p>They are: TILDE HOSTNAME FULL_HOSTNAME SUBSYSTEM USERNAME REAL_UID REAL_GID PID PPID IP_ADDRESS\n\n</p><p>Some of these are actual config file parameters, and others should be in the\nenvironmental classad we evaluate against.

It didn't go well.\n\n<p>The fundamental reason is that the proposed solution must evaluate, at runtime,\nthe default expression in order to determine the value of the option. Miron argues that if anything goes wrong with this evaluation, and is opinion is that in the field it will, it will generate a support nightmare.\n\n</p><p>He specifically desires a static (as best can be create) table of default values which are known a priori so there can be no circumstance under which the value of a default parameter is unevaluable.\n</p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1158\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1158'); return false;\" title=\"Condor Daemon Log can't grow beyond 2GB\">#1158</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nCondor Daemon Log can't grow beyond 2GB</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1175\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1175'); return false;\" title=\"Good error messages for invalid configuration settings\">#1175</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nGood error messages for invalid configuration settings</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Mar-30 11:59", "status": "stalled", "created": "2009-Nov-20 11:44", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-20 11:44", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "psilord", "derived_from": "#123", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu, willb@redhat.com, adesmet@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
