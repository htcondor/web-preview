{"id": 7629, "title": "Ticket #7629: figure out how to conclusively determine which credd we should use", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor storing and querying credentials such as Kerberos and OAuth, we assume that there is a CredD colocated with the SchedD we will be using to submit jobs.\n\n<p>Knowing how to contact the CredD is straightforward if we are talking to a local SchedD and CredD.  However, it's less clear what it means to contact \"The CredD\" when daemons are remote.\n\n</p><p>For Krb/OAuth, there is probably one CredD associated with each SchedD.  Do they need to have the same name?  Does the SchedD advertise its associated CredD?  How would a condor_submit client know who to store creds with to do a remote submit.  Etc.\n\n</p><p>However, in non-Krb/OAuth cases, we might have one CredD for the whole pool.  How is this communicated to condor_submit?  How is it specified in the config file?\n\n</p><p>This ticket is a broad umbrella to list different modes of operation we support, what assumptions are making for each, and proposals for making this easy for admins to configure.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:21", "status": "new", "created": "2020-May-01 16:16", "fixed_version": "2020-May-01 16:16", "broken_version": "v080900", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "#6734", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
