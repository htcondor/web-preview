Recently, i was trying to help stuart anderson from LIGO and could not come up with a good solution to his condor_history problems.\n\n<p>Summary of the rust ticket:\nuser stuart anderson at LIGO needs to debug old jobs using condor_history. He does not wish to run quill, has too many jobs to benefit from any kind of leave_in_queue hack, and is experiencing very long waits (almost 10 minutes) when looking up jobs direct by cluster id using condor_history.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Oct-09 14:11:17 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nAfter speaking with LIGO on 10/9/2009, they said that this was a low priority ticket. They'd like to keep it on the agenda because it is useful for debugging Condor problems. In the era of Google searches, waiting 5 minutes to search 10 million classads seems a bit slow....</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2015-Sep-21 10:59", "status": "defer", "created": "2009-Sep-28 17:01", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-28 17:01", "broken_version": "v070204", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "#279", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "a19725", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "griswold@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
