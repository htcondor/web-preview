However, I thought I'd report it in case it's not just me and there is a wider problem!\n\n</p><p>When I use the latest stable windows installer ( condor-7.6.3-winnt-x86.msi ), whether manually or scripted, I've noticed that HOSTALLOWWRITE (or 'hosts with write access' in the gui install) in the installation seems to be ignored. The behaviour I would expect is for this field to be added to the ALLOW_WRITE line in condor_config (is this the right expectation?!). However, this doesn't seem to be happening, instead it's sticking to its default:\n\n</p><p>ALLOW_WRITE = $(FULL_HOSTNAME), $(IP_ADDRESS)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Oct-13 11:37:05 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nPeople need to stop modifying the values listed here: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=WindowsInstallerConfig\">https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=WindowsInstallerConfig</a> without telling me, otherwise we'll keep seeing bugs like this with the installer.
