{"id": 2040, "title": "Ticket #2040: Inconsistent file permissions when creating job-related files", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen creating job output files, Condor is inconsistent in which permissions it uses. In many places, it uses 0644, 0664, or 0666 (condor_submit, condor_starter). In a few places, it uses 0600 (gahp_server, nordugrid_gahp). We should use the same permissions everywhere, with certain exceptions (credential files).\n\n<p>The OSG Glidein Factory is running in problems with this. Condor_submit will pre-create output files with 0644 permissions. If the files are deleted before the job completes (by a file cleanup utility), the gahp_server will recreate the files with 0600 permissions. They have tools that run as a different user that need to be able to read these files.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Apr-06 14:06", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Apr-06 14:06", "fixed_version": "2011-Apr-06 14:06", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "s8040", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
