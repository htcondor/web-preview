I believe that this is related to the use of 'fakeroot', which was failing on 0013 a couple of weeks ago, until I cleaned up leaked resources.  I informed Thawan (who reported the fakeroot problem to me) of the leak, but it appears to not be fixed.\n\n<p>You can view the open IPC resources with:\n</p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>$ ipcs -t\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and remove them with:\n</p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>$ ipcrm\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I'll take another pass at cleaning up the leaked resources, but this needs to be resolved.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Dec-03 10:37", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Dec-03 10:37", "fixed_version": "2010-Dec-03 10:37", "broken_version": "v070504", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "nleroy", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
