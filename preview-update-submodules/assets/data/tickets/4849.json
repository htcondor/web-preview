{"id": 4849, "title": "Ticket #4849: Rewrite all ads leaving collector on single-node pool", "description": "<blockquote>\n(Split off from <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4833\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4833'); return false;\" title=\"IPv6 bugfixes for 8.3.2\">#4833</a></span>.)\n\n<p>(It's not really a bug, but an issue when using dual-stack for the HTCondor-CE - so important for the OSG.)  In the case where all daemons are on a single node, we can perform address rewriting for all ads leaving the collector.  We should loosen the IP address rewriting rules to only match the IP, not the whole sinful.\n</p><ul>\n<li>Less aggressive, but would still fix the HTCondor-CE case is only rewriting ads when the sinful strings match <strong>or</strong> the same shared_port server is used.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jan-16 11:21 by tlmiller:</em>\n\n<p>I don't recall it at the moment -- more later, possibly, or maybe on Tuesday when Alan gets back -- but there's a really good reason we can't rewrite based only on IP address; it may not apply in this special case.  I guess we could offer a knob to force the collector to rewrite other people's ads?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jan-17 07:48:35 by bbockelm:</em>\n\n<p>Yeah, I went back and forth whether to rewrite based on (IP address) or (IP address+port+using shared_port).  I picked the less conservative choice in the commit; however, rewriting only sinfuls on the same shared port server would be fine with me and fix this use case.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jan-26 12:57:40 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nWhat's the use case where this matters?  Why do you have single-node pools that provides usable ads to other machines both IPv4 and IPv6?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jan-27 12:29:05 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Alan,\n\n<p>The use case here is HTCondor-CE.  It is a single-node setup that offers an offsite network service.  We'd like to be able to support IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and mixed-mode clients.\n\n</p><p>In master (or 8.3.3 branch), if IPv6 is enabled, IPv4-only HTCondor-G clients will receive a IPv6 sinful when querying for the schedd.  As this would break the majority of clients, we can't really turn on IPv6 for HTCondor-CE right now.\n\n</p><p>Thanks!\n\n</p><p>Brian\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Feb-09 15:44:00 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nAfter discussion, Todd and I think such a patch is reasonable if it's hidden behind a default-off knob. This is adding a non-trivial amount of complexity to a chunk of code we want to kill. Adding complexity means adding support for the near term. Hopefully by hiding it behind a knob support issues will be minimized.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Feb-11 14:58:51 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nWith apologies to Alan and Todd, I'm switching the parent ticket to the OSG master ticket instead of the IPv6 one (as we're calling this an OSG-specific hack).\n\n<p>Too bad we can't derive from multiple tickets :(.  Let me know if this will ruin your day.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Feb-12 07:53:09 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nTodd or Alan,\n\n<p>Can you do a quick review of the newly posted branch?\n\n</p><p>Brian\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Feb-16 16:47:54 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nSorry, I had only looked at it briefly and got caught on the big picture issues, which is what Todd and I discussed.
