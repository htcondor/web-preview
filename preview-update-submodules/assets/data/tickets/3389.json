But what if a user decides after the fact that he wants to change the priority of a DAG (relative to other DAGs)?\n\n</p><p>Sure, one can change the prios of nodes already in the Condor Queue. And for the others hold the DAG, rewrite the DAGMAN file and release the DAG. But this is hardly user friendly.\n\n</p><p>Instead, DAGMan should honor any change in its own priority setting, and adjust the relative priority of all the nodes accordingly. As a corollary, DAGMan should adjust the priorities also if it itself was submitted with a non-zero prio value.\n\n</p><p>Now, implementation wise, DAGMan should have no problems finding out that his own prio changed. condor_prio adds a dedicated event (033) to the DAGMan's event log.\n\n</p><p>For backwards compatibility, we may want to make this an optional feature.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 18:39:27 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nFirst problem: DAGMan does not read its own event log.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 18:40:46 by sfiligoi:</em> <br/>\n\nBut it could, right? Does not seem to be a major problem; the parsing code is essentially the same as for the nodes it is handling.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 18:50:22 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nThe log file is set up by condor_submit_dag, not condor_dagman.  It also seems like a bad idea for DAGMan to change state on its <em>own</em> events; it seems like a recipe for infinite loops or weird feedback loops if one is not careful.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 18:52:52 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nWhen the user edits the priority, it gets propogated to all the child nodes.  So the user only needs to edit the top parent level.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 19:01:38 by sfiligoi:</em> <br/>\n\nDAGMan represents the DAG; so changing its prio would seem logical to expect that this propagates to the DAG nodes as well.\n\n<p>Yes, as said above, I can potentially edit the file on disk, but this is like asking a user to change the Schedd's state file to alter a user job prio.\n(I understand that DAGMan is technically not part of HTCondor, but you do seem to make it look like it is)\n\n</p><p>As for finding out where its own event log is, condor_submit_dag could easily pass it as one of the arguments.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 19:05:41 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nI don't understand the simile.  The user writes the DAG file and submits the DAG.  To fix something, she puts the DAGman on hold, edits the DAG file, and releases the DAG.  There is nothing ex machina here.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 19:08:14 by sfiligoi:</em> <br/>\n\nThink how the job submission for regular HTCOndor jobs goes.\n\n<p>I crate a submit file (i.e. JDL) and pass it to condor_submit.\n\n</p><p>From now on, anything I do to that job happens through communication with the Schedd.\n\n</p><p>The user is never expected to \"pause the job, edit the submit file and release the job\" to alter its behavior.\n\n</p><p>I am trying to get away from the double standards here.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-18 20:20:33 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nThere is no double standard here.

The assumption seems\nto be that a change in DAGMan's priority will cause the same <strong>relative</strong>\nchange in the priorities of all node jobs, but this isn't explicit in\nthe design doc.  Also, I assume we want the same priority change to\naffect not-yet-submitted node jobs, but that's not discussed.\nWe need to specify the behavior in recovery mode and when running\na rescue DAG -- will the previous priority changes be re-effected in\nthose cases?\n\n<p></p></li><li>What about how this interacts with the existing priority scheme?\nIt looks like, in the current implementation of the code, doing a\ncondor_prio on DAGMan will only affect the priorities of not-yet-submitted\nnode jobs if the new DAGMan priority is higher than the job's existing\npriority.  But for already-submitted jobs, it looks like the relative\npriority change will happen to <strong>all</strong> jobs.\n\n<p></p></li><li>What if you <strong>decrease</strong> DAGMan's priority?

And if we just used condor_prio\nwe'd avoid the race condition described in the design document.\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>Why does the shadow need to be involved?\n\n<p></p></li><li>Assuming DAGMan finds out about priority changes to itself by reading\nits own log, I think that the events from the DAGMan log should be kept\nseparate from the events from the node job log(s).  In other words,\nthe DAGMan log should be read by a separate <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ReadMultipleUserLogs\" title=\"Read Multiple User Logs\">ReadMultipleUserLogs</a></span>\nobject.  That would avoid any ambiguity about whether a priority change\nevent belonged to DAGMan itself or to a child job.\n\n<p></p></li><li>DAGMan <strong>should</strong> truncate its own log if not running in recovery mode\n(maybe it should also avoid truncating its log if it's running a rescue\nDAG).  (So we don't re-do old priority changes that are probably not\nrelevant to the current run.)\n\n<p></p></li><li>Instead of running condor_qedit (or condor_prio) on the node jobs,\nwe should just directly make a connection to the schedd like we already\ndo to put the workflow status info into DAGMan's classad.  Note:  the\n\"Changing job attribute\" event is written by the schedd, so bypassing the\ncondor_prio command shouldn't cause any problems.\n\n<p></p></li><li>This code:\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><pre>  if(node-&gt;_hasNodePriority &amp;&amp; node-&gt;hasNodePriority &gt; _defaultPriority){\n</pre>\n\n<p>looks wrong to me.
