{"id": 1861, "title": "Ticket #1861: RFE: JOB_FAMILY_MEMORY_LIMIT expression to control memory size", "description": "<blockquote>\nLIGO desires a feature where a starter can set the hard ulimit of the job family it starts up based upon slot attributes in the machine ad.\n\n<p>I propose a new machine classad attribute:\n\n</p><p><code>JOB_FAMILY_HARD_MEMORY_LIMIT = expr</code>\n\n</p><p>which is an expression and evaluated in context of the machine's slot ad as MY and the job ad as TARGET. If the result of the evaluation produces a defined integer greater than zero, it will be interpreted as the megabytes in size to which the job family will be hardlimited with <code>setrlimit()</code>. If less than zero, zero, or undefined, it will have no effect.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jan-24 14:39:23 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nFirst, note this needs to be the virtual memory, not the physical memory, which could be a problem for some jobs.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Feb-10 14:51:43 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nMore generally, we'd like to know if Condor can help use to OS to enforce cpu/memory/disk limits.
