{"id": 120, "title": "Ticket #120: Crondor jobs spam ScheddLog with \"Requirements attribute...evaluated\"", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe \"Crondor\" functionality works, in part, by manipulating the Requirements expression for a job.  So you might end up with something like this:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">Requirements = (Arch == \"INTEL\") &amp;&amp; (OpSys == \"LINUX\") &amp;&amp; (Disk &gt;= DiskUsage) &amp;&amp; ((Memory * 1024) &gt;=\nImageSize) &amp;&amp; (((CurrentTime + ScheddInterval) &gt;= (DeferralTime - DeferralPrepTime)) &amp;&amp; (CurrentTime\n&lt; (DeferralTime + DeferralWindow)))</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>If the job is a local universe job, these will be periodically evaluated.  When the job doesn't run (because its time hasn't come yet), you'll get log messages like this:\n\n</p><p>10/22 17:47:01 (pid:29249) The Requirements attribute for job 706.0 evaluated to false. Unable to start job\n\n</p><p>If you've got a few dozen Crondor jobs, each spraying this message every few minutes, your <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ScheddLog\" title=\"Schedd Log\">ScheddLog</a></span> because hard to read, is full of scary things that you should ignore, and causes teh log to rotate unnecessarily.\n\n</p><p>Expected behavior: No log messages by default.\n\n</p><p>Proposed change: schedd.C lin 5967, change D_ALWAYS to D_FULLDEBUG.\n\n</p><p>Possible complications: This code handles all local universe jobs, not just Crondor.  For \"normal\" local universe jobs, having Requirements evaluate to false may be problematic and worth logging; there is no other obvious place where the information is captured.\n\n</p><p>(Imported from <span class=\"drupalnode\"><a href=\"http://drupal-old.batlab.cs.wisc.edu/node/1698\">1698 (backup)</a> <a href=\"http://nmi.cs.wisc.edu/node/1698\">1698 (public)</a></span>)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 14:50", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-26 11:42", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-26 11:42", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
