I think the Pegasus end is more logical, but it sounds like that's not likely to happen.\n\n</p><p>Another thing is, we need to do a bunch of cross-version testing; for example, we should test the latest released Pegasus with the tip of the development and stable branches, to make sure we don't make changes that will end up breaking Pegasus.  Probably we should also test the tip of Pegasus development against some version of Condor.\n\n</p><p>Right now we don't have any testing like this, so if we introduce some incompatibility, we usually find out about it from our users...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2013-Oct-02 11:33", "status": "defer", "created": "2013-Oct-02 11:33", "fixed_version": "2013-Oct-02 11:33", "broken_version": "v080003", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#3890", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
