{"id": 1758, "title": "Ticket #1758: Aggregate submit file access checks", "description": "<blockquote>\nAfter submitting its jobs, condor_submit sends requests to the schedd to check whether it can access the jobs' files. Submit uses a new connection for each file check. Thus, if you submit more than 15,000 jobs, each with stdout and stderr, you burn through all of the ephemeral ports on the machine. For the next 30 seconds or so, they are in TIME_WAIT state. We've seen problems with the gridmanager being unable to connect to the schedd or any remote machines due to a lack of ports.\n\n<p>The ATTEMPT_ACCESS command should be replaced with a more efficient version that takes a list of files to check in one command.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:50:47 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:20:02 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:20", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Nov-05 13:30", "fixed_version": "2010-Nov-05 13:30", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "atlas", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
