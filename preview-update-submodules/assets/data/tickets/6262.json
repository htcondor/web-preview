{"id": 6262, "title": "Ticket #6262: Parse splices lazily", "description": "<blockquote>\n(I thought there was already a ticket for this, but I'm not finding one.  Hopefully I'm not creating a duplicate.)\n\n<p>Anyhow, one of the main advantages of sub-DAGs over splices is that sub-DAGs are parsed lazily.  Since we'd like to encourage the use of splices, and make splices and sub-DAGs as much alike as possible, it would be great to parse splices lazily rather than eagerly as they are now.\n\n</p><p>One obstacle to this is splice connections (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5213\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5213'); return false;\" title=\"Allow more flexible dependencies between splices\">#5213</a></span>) -- possibly we'd just disallow lazy parsing if you have splice connections?\n\n</p><p>(Also see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6048\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6048'); return false;\" title=\"Have separate Dag objects for splices?\">#6048</a></span>: Have separate Dag objects for splices? and <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"stalled\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3587\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3587'); return false;\" title='Add \"socket\" nodes for splices'>#3587</a></span>: Add \"socket\" nodes for splices.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-May-16 13:31:21 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nSeems like having socket nodes implemented would make this a lot easier -- we could create the appropriate socket nodes in the parent DAG object when we parse that DAG, and they could kind of be \"placeholders\"; then, when we parse the splice DAG file, we'd insert the appropriate nodes between the socket nodes.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Jan-02 16:52", "status": "stalled", "created": "2017-May-16 12:31", "fixed_version": "2017-May-16 12:31", "broken_version": "v080701", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
