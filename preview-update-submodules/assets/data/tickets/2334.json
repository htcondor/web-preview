Do you know what in the proxy makes the code go into the inner loop?\n\n<p>My only comment on the patch is that we should check the value of <code>email</code> in the outer loop guard, not <code>email2</code>, since that's the variable we use after the loop.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jul-27 13:30:24 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBased on our testing, this bug will be triggered by any proxy that's delegated over the network or created from a certificate that doesn't have an 'X509v3 Subject Alternative Name' field.
