The only way to do this with the current book format is to promote each appendix to be called a Chapter.  But, whatever; it is done.\n\n<p>Also done is to have the contents of the tables in said appendix not run off the right side of the page, never to be seen again.  This requires hand-separating long lines of prose onto different rows of the table.  Fine for the pdf, but it makes the html look stupid.  There is no cure for both html and pdf.\n\n</p><p>Did I mention that <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LaTex\" title=\"La Tex\">LaTex</a></span> is stupid?  With the change above, the floating tables really floated, and there was no way or package that correctly placed the tables <strong>within</strong> their subsections!  Since the subsections were used instead of captions, they were useless.  So, out went the subsection headers, and in went captions to label the contents of the table.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Sep-16 14:36</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/b6da998d988232d5d918390a18b4326c8969aaaa\">[25000]</a></span>: fix gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=737\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('737'); return false;\" title=\"Appendices don't show up in pdf manual TOC\">#737</a></span>: show appendices in pdf TOC.
