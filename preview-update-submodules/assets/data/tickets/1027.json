{"id": 1027, "title": "Ticket #1027: Gridmanager ads should include rate information", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe gridmanager ads in the collector include counts of jobs in various states at the time the ad is created. But there's no good way to determine the rate at which jobs are progressing through the system from these snapshots. The ads should be expanded to include some rate indicators. For example, the number of new and completed jobs over time. These counts could be since the last ad or since the birth of the gridmanager.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:19", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Dec-07 16:36", "fixed_version": "2009-Dec-07 16:36", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "atlas", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
