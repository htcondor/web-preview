{"id": 5411, "title": "Ticket #5411: Scaling support & testing", "description": "<blockquote>\nAt the scales we envisage testing at, we'll probably need a collector tree.  We'll need to adjust condor_annex to work with collector trees, automate setting them up, or eliminate the need for them.  There's a patch from Brian Bockleman which purports to do the latter.\n\n<p>We could use \"classic\" collector trees as suggested by the <a class=\"external\" href=\"/wiki-archive/pages/HowToSetUpElasticComputeCloudPools\">wiki</a>; we already have a script running at start-up to configure the startd.\n\n</p><p>We could use the shared port daemon to distribute (to minimize memory usage, by consistent hashing of origin address?) connections to a \"special\" socket name (e.g., \"collector_tree\") among a set of daemons (e.g., with sockets named \"collector_tree_0\", \"collector_tree_1\",..).  This may be out-of-scope for the current work.\n\n</p><p>Brian Bockleman's patch does not appear to handle blocking authentication methods very well, so it may be out of the scope of this work.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Dec-09 22:35:07 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nBlocking methods should be just fine (in fact, it'll convert things to non-blocking for the parent), but they'll be nowhere nearly as performant as non-blocking methods.\n\n<p>What auth method are you targeting?

It's not clear that your current architecture -- no explicit queue and strict round-robin amongst a fixed number of workers -- will allow the parent process to handle a whole pool all by its lonesome if it's using a blocking security mechanism.  (As far as I can tell, in fact, the parent process will block during hand-off if the unix domain socket's buffer is full.)\n\n</p><p>By the way, what's the largest pool a single collector has been able to handle with GSI and this patch?\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"restricted\"><p><i>What auth method are you targeting?
