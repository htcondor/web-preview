If there are specific tests which show contrary results, please attach entire repro instructions.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-16 16:03:22 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nHow/what did you benchmark? Where are the results of your benchmarking?  What is the memory footprint and cpu utilization with the caching code on -vs- off? It is not a matter of \"memory utilization is less\" with caching on or off, it is important to have even a ballpark feel for how much less.  If, for instance, the memory footprint is reduced by 10% on a typically collection of 3000 machine ads, I do not think the complexity of the caching code is worth it at 10%.... on the other hand, if we are talking 50%, that is very different.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-16 16:18:21 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nUsing valgrind massif as mentioned, I showed TJ the initial collector reports on a simple personal condor\n\n<p>The tests are contrived personal condor with overloaded startd to look like 2 machines with 16 CPU's each.\n\n</p><p>~20% savings is memory.\n~10% iLoc savings (it's difficult to determine what this means when compiling release exes)\n\n</p><p>Difficulty is that I need to test on a real environment to get data.  It's all set to test on a live env and I would like to be around to help verify.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-16 17:05:52 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nHow did you get the 20% memory savings number?  Is this the difference in the private data usage of the collector with caching enabled vs disabled?\n\n<p>What does \"iLoc\" mean?\n\n</p><p>Agree we need to verify stability in a real beta environment, but for benchmarking: instead of a test with just 32 similar ads all coming from the same startd, how about doing a test like we discussed a couple months back?  E.g. take a realistic collector snapshot like <code>condor_status -pool cm.chtc.wisc.edu -l</code>, save it to a file, and then have a small 10 line program (ideally that lives in the test suite) that simply reads in all the ads into a classad list.  Report the private memory usage and run time of this program with caching enabled, and again with caching disabled.\n\n</p><p>Here are the results I got back in December doing the above:\n</p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>3181 ads, 525201 attributes, 35324 unique attribute values\n\nWith No Caching\n10 seconds, 235 MB\n\nWith Caching\n20 seconds, 191 MB\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I will try to re-run this test as a sanity data point.  Most concerning with the above was the fact that the run-time doubled (!!) with caching on, hopefully that is no longer the case.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-16 17:22:00 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nBecause its tr1 heavy you need to be sure to test release mode\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-16 21:53:58 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nI've created some unit tests, and I'm seeing the oddity, investigating.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-17 13:22:32 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nDecrease on CHTC test data was ~68.2% of original, so on chtc it saved ~32%, which is pretty good.\n\n<p>32% of 8GB = 2.58GB of savings..

If so, how did that come to 8GB of ads in your tests -- it should be more like 200MB.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-17 14:37:58 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nThe data is all attached, and the test data is in the repo along with the tests.\n\n<p>The projected savings from 8 GB was extrapolated from the percentage.\n\n</p><p>I'm about 85% confident now the reason you were seeing a slowdown was the crufty unorder map ++ VS.2008.\n\n</p><p>It would be really interesting to compare against 2012 with C++11 enabled.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-17 15:15:47 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nConfirmed.. I tested an EL5, EL6, and Fedora all with consistent results.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-17 15:55:56 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nJust for another data point, TJ is building his test on Linux now...\n\n<p>In general, considering the mostly single-threaded nature of the daemons, performance is more important than memory usage (except in the Shadow, but the Shadow doesn't hold a lot of classads anyhow). It is a hard call if ~20% memory savings is worth a ~7% performance hit plus a lot of extra code (aka extra surface area w/ bug risks, maintenance costs, etc).\n\n</p><p>Couple random thoughts that perhaps could significantly improve the situation with the current code:\n</p><ol>\n<li>How about not caching attribute values that are numbers (ints, floats, etc)?  Seems like these don't really save any space and yet still cost cpu cycles.\n</li><li>Where is the unordered map being used - in the cache where keys are the attribute names?  Attribute name strings are pretty long; are we sure just using a regular map (instead of unordered map) isn't a better choice?  With an unordered map, the entire key must be scanned to hash it, while with an ordered map we only need to scan enough to know if it is lexically less than another key.\n</li><li>How easy/hard is it to string space (ref count) the attribute names?  Old classads did this btw.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-17 15:59:14 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nIt's more like 30%, and the performance hit was only on a single insertion test, as mentioned previously I have other tests that show increased performance, but I wanted to compare apples to apples.\n\n<p>30% memory performance at scale will also yield greater cpu performance.. I think it's worth while doing some real tests now.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-17 16:06:38 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nI would be happy to sit down with Jamie (who is intimately familiar with classads) and brainstorm ideas.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-17 17:13:09 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nUsing your test data, in my condor_q -profile rig. 64bit SL6 binaries built in NMI.
