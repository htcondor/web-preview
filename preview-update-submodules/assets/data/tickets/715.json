I'll see what we can do about getting more disk available on these nodes.  Have you checked all of the Solaris machines, since some have disks partitioned differently?  You could also submit the job via Metronome. I know it's not the easiest for porting, but you would run in the condor execute dir and be guaranteed enough space.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-05 12:27:26 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nEach time you have to specify --without to configure we should consider that a bug in configure.ac.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-08 13:52:28 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nCondor builds for all of these platforms are available on nmi-s006 in ~nleroy/public/v7.4 .\n\n<p>These were all built with the following configuration flags:\n</p><ul>\n<li>--disable-proper\n</li><li>--without-globus\n</li><li>--without-krb5\n</li><li>--disable-full-port\n</li><li>--without-voms\n</li><li>--wthout-srb\n</li><li>--without-hadoop\n</li><li>--without-postgresql\n</li><li>--without-curl\n</li><li>--with-pcre\n</li><li>--disable-quill\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Additional flags were used on various builds as required.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-02 11:15:44 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI've taken over this ticket and my task is to integrate Nick's work into our glue\nscripts.\n\n<p>The work I've done so far involved altering the submit_info file format to allow specification of configure arguments to both the build and test glues.\n\n</p><p>Here is some rationale behind it:\n\n</p><p>The main problems concerning integrating Nick's work (which weren't\ncaused by Nick, but something I ran into in the course of continuing\nhis work) were:\n\n</p><p>1. You couldn't pass arbitrary configure arguments for either the builds\nor the tests that varied by platform.\n\n</p><p>2. The automatic building of a platform defined in submit_info was\ncoupled to the presence of the platform description in submit_info.\n\n</p><p>This meant a platform that normally wasn't built could be specified on\nthe command line to condor_nmi_submit, but then couldn't have any prereqs\nassociated with it, since associating prereqs with it would cause it to\nbe built in the nightlies, etc, etc, etc. So, if you wanted to do a one off\nof a platform which required a prereq, you were out of luck.\n\n</p><p>3. Whitespace handling in submit_info was a complete joke and was never\nthought about in the parsing code. The parsing code was also pretty large\npile of unmaintainable and confusing trash.\n\n</p><p>4. There was no good way to build/test condor on unknown platforms which\nneeded arbitrary configure args, prereqs, or other things in an attempt\nto try to build a port noone has ever tried on before and noone knows\nanything about. As an example, suppose x86_64_fedora_12 comes out tomorrow\nand NMI finds that they can run some other port on it so it shows up\nin the pool. There is no good way to run a test build on that platform\nthrough NMI itself since number 1 and 2 from above opposed the action\nand you couldn't specify all of the configure flags to turn everything,\nor just a subset of features, off.\n\n</p><p>So, I rewrote the horrible submit_info file to be a pure perl syntax\nSubmitInfo.pm file where we encode everything we care about the build and\ntest of every platform into statically initialized data structures. It\nis nice to have ONE place in a file where <em>everything</em> for that platform\nis specified and it makes adjusting the build and test parameters\nfor a platform hilariously easy and almost context free. Then I fixed\ncondor_nmi_submit to load this module at run time (after checking it\nout of git if need be, etc), and write all of the build/test glue using it.\n\n</p><p>One very nice feature I added was that you now specify build/test sets\nof platforms in SubmitInfo.pm and give them real names. for example,\nI can type this now:\n\n</p><p>./condor_nmi_submit &lt;args&gt; --platforms=official_ports\n\n</p><p>and get all of the ports we natively compile and officially wish to\ndistribute. Of course, it is smart, so you can do\n\n</p><p>--platforms=official_ports,ia64_rhas_4\n\n</p><p>and it'll produce the union of the set and the platform, it even works\nwhen and if you supply multiple sets in addition to individual platforms.\nBy default, if you don't specify any platforms, you get 'official_ports'.\n\n</p><p>As a bonus, the SubmitInfo.pm file is actually also a perl executable\nwhich you can run. It will typecheck what you wrote to ensure that you\ntyped in legal information, answer simple questions about the information,\nor generate interesting reports about the data--like which platforms\nuse what prereq and stuff like that.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-04 16:05:42 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI have workspace build, tests, and builds with automatic tests working.\n\n<p>I need to figure out how the nightlies work, and why when various people want to submit a branch build, they use /home/cndrauto's copy of condor_nmi_submit, and why that file seems to get updated all the time.\n\n</p><p>I need to figure out how to test these things outside of the current nightlies so when I replace it it just works.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-04 16:50:20 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nDon't do x86_64_sles_8 cause nmi doesn't want it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-05 11:41:20 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nAs part of this work, I'm currently updating the <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=BuildingCondorOnUnix\" title=\"Building Condor On Unix\">BuildingCondorOnUnix</a></span> wiki page. The edits are extensive, so I'm doing them offline and will bring them online in one step.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-09 16:44:14 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nFixed the compilation problems with sun4u_sol_5.8. I believe all the ones NMI wants are able to be built and tested.\n\n<p>I have to test building the branches and modules aspect of condor_nmi_submit, but I'm rapidly approaching completion.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-10 13:03:52 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI've run into a small roadblock since it seems the test suites were never run on\nsome of these platforms nick did his port to. For example, even though --disable-full-port is specified, the stduniv test suites are still run.\n\n<p>I have to do some configure.ac work to fix the problem and I don't think it is a big deal, just some time to spend.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-10 14:43:13 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nFor the interested, the binaries of my snapshot builds are here:\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">nmi-s006:~nleroy/public/v7.4\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-16 12:34:19 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nRan into a problem where passing --disable-full-port to a build configure, but not a test configure led to the belief in the test suite that it was for a stduniv port. This was due to the testing \"sense\" of configure in where unless you specifically stated a platform was not a full port, it assumed it was.\n\n<p>My fix is reversing the sense of this test, thereby on platforms configure doesn't know about very well, the default is a clipped sense.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-17 14:14:34 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI reversed the sense and tested it, it seems to work.\n\n<p>At this point, it would appear that for workspace builds, the official ports and the nmi one off sets build and test properly.\n\n</p><p>Now examining branch builds and figuring out how to test those.\n\n</p><p>There is going to be a \"rectification\" when I push this stuff across all the branches with our nightly.pl script. It is yet unknown what form it will take. If I'm lucky, it'll be a Slor.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-17 16:46:24 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nFound a bug, or a feature, who knows since it isn't documented, where when using\n--src-tag and --other-tag, the nmi_tools and glue is checked out from origin/master! I fixed it to check it out of --src-tag instead, as that seems much more likely for what someone expects.\n\n<p>I suspect when using --tag it also got it out of origin/master, and for that it now also gets it out of what is supplied in --tag.\n\n</p><p>None of this crap is documented so figuring out how it is intended to work is difficult.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-18 10:35:15 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I'm in a quagmire in debugging this stuff.\n\n<p>As far as I understand, when you do a workspace build, you check out the glue from origin/master. Since I'm changing the glue, this is obviously wrong. Supplying the --nmi-glue flag doesn't fix it in that I also need a different nmi_tools directory in addition to an nmi_glue directory so I can get the right copy of condor_nmi_submit.\n\n</p><p>This is sad because I had worksapce builds working, made a change in order to get branch builds working, then broke workspace builds. It seems I can have one or the other. :(\n\n</p><p>The only reason it works on other branches is because the nmi_tools and nmi_glue directories are identical across most of our source branches.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-23 15:22:42 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm stalling this ticket until 7.4.1 is released.\n\n<p>The next step after 7.4.1 gets released is:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>Squash merge V7_4-submit_info-branch into V7_4-branch.\n</li><li>Merge V7_4-branch into master\n</li><li>git fetch as cndrauto the repository on nmi_s006.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>Then, after the builds pass of fail:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>revert the V7_4-branch commit\n</li><li>merge the reversion into the master.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>Then, if everything succeeded, really merge V7_4-submit_info into V7_4-branch and\nmerge V7_4-branch into master.\n\n</p><p>The reason for all of this mess is:\n\n</p><p>The origin/master copy of nmi_tool/condor_nmi_submit is checked out by nightly.pl. Then that instance of condor_nmi_submit will check out the\nsubmit_info (or in my case SubmitInfo.pm) <strong>from each branch in the tags file</strong> and submit the build. If any of the checkouts fail, none of the nightlies are submitted. So, all branches in the nightlies must contain the same glue for any of the branches to be submitted to NMI.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jan-04 16:18:24 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\n7.4.1 and 7.2.5 have been released. I'm going to continue on this task.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jan-21 10:41:58 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI haven't had time to perform this task due to time starvation.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jan-21 13:38:21 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I'm to work on this task since my other one exploded in time requirements.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jan-25 15:25:31 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I've prepared another instance of a squash merge of V7_4-submit_info_branch into V7_4-branch and then into master. I will push it in the morning and kick off a run of the nightlies. If they start building, everything is likely good. I will revisit this tomorrow morning.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jan-26 13:07:00 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, due to the NMI dog and pony show, where they are doing live demos, my merge test of this branch has been delayed until thursday.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Feb-02 10:24:34 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI squashed merged V7_4-submit_info-branch into V7_4-branch, then merged it into master. I pushed the changes on Feb 1, 2010.\n\n<p>It all seemed to work, except I forgot to change the default testclass run by the nightliy test suite away from 'simple' to 'quick'. This has now been done.\n\n</p><p>I've found one kind of nasty problem, which I wrote into <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=974\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('974'); return false;\" title=\"NMI Glue is a Pit of Despair\">#974</a></span> as well.\n\n</p><p>Basically, not only does the glue code expect to be identical across all branches (except for the SubmitInfo.pm file), it expects to be identical across\nall time as well. What this means is that we don't have the capability of easily rebuilding tags and branches previous to Feb 1, 2010 because the new glue\ncode expects to see the new concepts it wants on past tags and branches.\n\n</p><p>Since I made significant changes to how some of the glue scripts handle their arguments, backwards compatibility changes would be pretty time consuming to perform, and even more time consuming to test. I vote we just say goodbye to the ability to build previous things and move on with our lives.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Feb-10 10:24:42 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nAfter several more days of watching. It appears there was one more issue which I've already fixed and seen work, but I'll describe here.\n\n<p>The issues was in the nightly.pl build script, we call condor_nmi_submit with --nightly and that checks out each SubmitInfo.pm file associated with a branch, and submits a build. The problem was that once SubmitInfo.pm was loaded, if we tried to load it again (say for a different branch), perl's module idempotency check caused the module to not be loaded, but report as having loaded properly.\n\n</p><p>Since the V7_4-branch and master SubmitInfo.pm files were so close together, I hadn't noticed this.\n\n</p><p>The fix was to do some hackery with perl's module system and delete the knowledge of the loaded module from perl's global module state so when the load module happened again the module would actually load. In this scenario, the definitions of the exported symbols and whatnot override the previous definitions, which is what we want. Some warnings are emitted about redefinitions of functions which I hadn't figured out how to quiet, but they are harmless in this situation.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Feb-15 15:27:51 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI had to fix nightly.pl as described in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1199\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1199'); return false;\" title=\"Make a nightly script to build non-official platforms in NMI\">#1199</a></span>, but that seems to be fixed now.\n\n<p>So, the status of the ticket at this time is:\n\n</p><p>The special nmi ports build and test set is being submitted to nmi nightly. However, some of them are failing and need some tender loving care.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-05 13:05:32 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI requested the filesystems for HPUX to have flags set upon them which should allow tar to make &gt;2GB files. When NMI comes back online, we'll see if it worked.\n\n<p>I fixed the solaris 5.8 build to not fail. This worked.\n\n</p><p>I've poked Nick to install the new binaries on nmi-0062, the segfaulting x86_suse_10.2 machine.
