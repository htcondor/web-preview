{"id": 924, "title": "Ticket #924: schedd should write submit event", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe schedd, rather than condor_submit, should write the submit event for a job.  This would prevent a log file from ever having an execute event for a job before the submit event, and would also help with job submission via SOAP.  It should also reduce the need for file locking on log files.  (Matt wants to get rid of the no-NFS-log files default for DAGMan jobs, and fixing this would be part of the solution for allowing log files on NFS.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Dec-12 09:05:55 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is related to <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=431\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('431'); return false;\" title=\"Submit events in EVENT_LOG from SOAP submission\">#431</a></span>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-17 11:11:52 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nJust be careful.  I think the goal is worthy, but just keep in mind that moving the fsync of the user log from submit to the schedd could make schedd performance worse in some cases.  Be sure to optimize it so that a large job cluster sharing the same user log will generate only one fsync to that user log rather than one per job.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 14:29:27 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is identical to <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1441\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1441'); return false;\" title=\"Move write of submit event from condor_submit to schedd\">#1441</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=963\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('963'); return false;\" title=\"Have a Condor event logging daemon that does all log file writing\">#963</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nHave a Condor event logging daemon that does all log file writing</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Oct-20 22:16", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Nov-09 17:19", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-09 17:19", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#1284", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
