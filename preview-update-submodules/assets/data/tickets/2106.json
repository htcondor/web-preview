So if the offline state notification does not make it to all collectors, the startd will not hibernate.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\ndue to other more high-priority items, this ticket likely isn't getting any cycles this week.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Sep-21 14:24:01 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nNote: although this code is technically a defect, the patch is slated for the master branch.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Feb-13 13:16", "status": "stalled", "created": "2011-Apr-27 15:12", "fixed_version": "2011-Apr-27 15:12", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "support", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
