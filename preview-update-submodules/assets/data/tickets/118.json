{"id": 118, "title": "Ticket #118: GitTrac: Add ticket to report links", "description": "<blockquote>\nTake a look at a typical ticket; say <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=111\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('111'); return false;\" title=\"Merge OSG ProcD into Condor\">#111</a></span> for example.  There are several entries in the \"Properties\" section that would be natural links to matching reports.  \"enhance\" could link to all enhance tickets.  gquinn could link to add tickets assigned to or created by gquinn, as appropriate.  Daemons could link to all tickets with a subsystem of Daemons.  Obviously low priority, but would be a nice touch.  I noticed this when submitting a Dag ticket, and wished I could just click \"Dag\" to see all of the other tickets to make sure I hadn't entered a duplicate.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 17:28", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-26 11:34", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-26 11:34", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#3", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
