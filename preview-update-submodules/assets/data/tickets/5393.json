{"id": 5393, "title": "Ticket #5393: HTCondor View: Filter on timestamps relative to \"now\"", "description": "<blockquote>\nYou can currently filter based on dates and perhaps timestamps, but it would be a fixed date/timestamp. What we generally want are time relative to \"now.\" So a display of the last day's worth of data would be \"filter=timestamp&gt;=now-24 hours\" or somesuch.\n\n<p>We could do the filter when we build the graph. On the up side, it would allow some meaningful zooming out. On the down side, it could potentially double the amount of data being considered; early filters are faster. Also, it still means we need some interface to specify the date range.\n\n</p><p>Of particular use with <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5392\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5392'); return false;\" title=\"HTCondor View: Merge multiple data files\">#5392</a></span> Merge multiple data files.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Nov-12 00:44", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Nov-12 00:44", "fixed_version": "2015-Nov-12 00:44", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5351", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
