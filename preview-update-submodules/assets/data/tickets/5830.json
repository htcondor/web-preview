{"id": 5830, "title": "Ticket #5830: Clarify wording re: job router hooks", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom Jose Caballero:\n\n<p>here I am again with a question about the documentation in  <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.5/4_4Hooks.html#SECTION00542000000000000000\">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.5/4_4Hooks.html#SECTION00542000000000000000</a>\n\n</p><p>I read this\n\"Routing is still managed by the condor_job_router daemon, but if the Job Router Hooks are specified, then these hooks will be used to transform and monitor the job instead.\"\nThat can be interpreted as that, if you sets the hooks (for example the ***_HOOK_TRANSLATE_JOB), that will be the only step used by the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobRouter\" title=\"Job Router\">JobRouter</a></span> to manipulate the job classads.\nBut that is not what the code really does. It just applies the HOOK first, not instead.\nMaybe it can be rephrase in the docs so that is mentioned explicitly? Just an idea....</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2017-May-30 17:26", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Aug-05 14:27", "fixed_version": "2016-Aug-05 14:27", "broken_version": "v080506", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
