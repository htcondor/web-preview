Neither of these options is very helpful for debugging.  In some situations it would therefore be preferable to provide separate stdout and stderr pipes.  In addition, a convenience function should be added that does all the work of running a command and reading all of the stderr + stdout output into strings.\n\n<p>One case where this has come up is in the invocation of the hibernation plugin in startd_hibernation.cpp.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Nov-28 11:28", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Nov-28 10:43", "fixed_version": "2011-Nov-28 10:43", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
