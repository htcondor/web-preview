{"id": 4784, "title": "Ticket #4784: User history file", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, the post-job for CMS CRAB3 has to parse all of the user log to find some simple statistics for the job that just ended (the alternate is to use condor_history, but that's similarly expensive).  This has gotten increasingly expensive as users run a few thousand nodes per DAG.\n\n<p>All of the information we need is in the final <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> dropped in the $PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR; unfortunately, we need <strong>all</strong> the jobs associated with a node, meaning this approach isn't really going to work.\n\n</p><p>Instead, I'd like to see a top-level submit command:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>history = /path/to/file\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This file gets the final job classad appended by the schedd at the same time it writes the final terminate event (so it's always available to the postjob).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Dec-17 09:47:33 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed an example implementation.\n\n<p>We'll need to think about the \"naming\" issues of this feature.  If we want a classad available to the postjob script, we must write to this file immediately before updating the user log.  <strong>However</strong>, the job has not yet exited the queue when this occurs - hence, it's not really the same as the ad in condor_history!\n\n</p><p>A pithy example - when the shadow writes the terminate event (meaning that the postjob may fire up 1ms later), the job ad still lists itself as <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobStatus\" title=\"Job Status\">JobStatus</a></span> = 2 (running).\n\n</p><p>This is sufficient for our use case (even with the \"wrong\" <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobStatus\" title=\"Job Status\">JobStatus</a></span>), but possibly shouldn't be named the \"history\" file.\n\n</p><p>Suggestions?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Feb-05 19:33:25 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nOn the HTCondor / CMS call, we came up with an approach that could implement this with existing mechanisms.
