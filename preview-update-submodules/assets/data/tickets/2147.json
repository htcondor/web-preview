{"id": 2147, "title": "Ticket #2147: Optionally encode date/time in rotated log file names", "description": "<blockquote>\nSome users like having the date and possibly time included in the filenames of rotated log.

The user who requested the feature was interested in the schedd's HISTORY log.\n\n</p><p>Benefits:\n</p><ul>\n<li>A given log file, once \"aged\", never moves, providing consistency for the user.\n</li><li>Instead of having to rename all of the old files and delete the oldest, you just delete the oldest.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Drawbacks:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Identifying the oldest log file is trickier, especially if the mtime isn't reliable.\n</li><li>If you let the user specify the format (probably using something like a strftime formatting string), it becomes possible for two filenames to collide.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-May-10 17:11:43 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nThe user who originally asked (admin 22103) was interested in having the history files include the date <em>as a way to speed up condor_history calls</em>.  The benefit would be decidedly dubious, although I've put out a request for more information.  While as an option this idea remains appealing for the reasons above, demand seems low and the benefits small.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-May-10 17:11", "status": "new", "created": "2011-May-09 14:46", "fixed_version": "2011-May-09 14:46", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "a22103", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
