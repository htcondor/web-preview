These would have details of how people got their particular application running on HTCondor.  An example might be, \"I have a bunch of analysis jobs that each take 48 hours to run, and I want to run 1000 of them\".  So details would be stuff like, \"how did they actually get their jobs to run on HTCondor at all\"; \"how did the break the 48 hour chunks up into smaller pieces\"; \"how big were the input and output files, and how did they deal with them\"; \"how did the fit the whole thing into some kind of DAG\", 'here's a problem to watch out for\", etc., etc.\n\n</p><p>The goal would be to eventually have a number of these, each representing a fairly common case, that we could point a new HTCondor user to and say, \"Okay, here's an example of how someone did something similar to your use case.\"\n\n</p><p>I think Miron sees these being developed by talking to actual HTCondor users and finding out what they had to do to get their stuff to run.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2013-Jul-26 13:33", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jul-26 13:33", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-26 13:33", "broken_version": "v080001", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Engagement", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, smoler@cs.wisc.edu, lmichael@wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
