{"id": 4074, "title": "Ticket #4074: Some tests write multiple saveme directories", "description": "<blockquote>\nSome tests write multiple PID-named directories under their saveme directory for a single run.  This isn't obvious and slightly complicated debugging.  For example, lib_shared_port-check-ports_van.run will create two directories: one will contain a copy of the job log and the test's output, the other will contain the HTCondor configuration and logs used for the test.  They should be unified  into a single directory.  I strongly suspect other tests have the same problem, they should also be identified and fixed; there may be a core issue that can be addressed.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Nov-18 13:46", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Nov-18 13:46", "fixed_version": "2013-Nov-18 13:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
