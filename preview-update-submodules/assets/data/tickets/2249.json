Only one of them left the queue during the second hold/release cycle. I see a lot of 'Job 253.-1: not runnable' in the schedd log, so I'm not convinced that's directly related to the problem. Also, the details look different than <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1900\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1900'); return false;\" title=\"Running jobs leave queue when held\">#1900</a></span>. That is, the shadow isn't setting <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobStatus\" title=\"Job Status\">JobStatus</a></span> to 6 (TRANSFERRING_OUTPUT) in the schedd just before exiting.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-16 16:46:17 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nIn tracing it looks to be a race condition on shutdown, because it appears that the shadows are cleaning up after the status has changed from the 2nd modification.  Maybe there needs to be some additional logic here.\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">case JOB_KILLED:\n\t// If the job isn't being HELD, we'll remove it\n\tif ( q_status != HELD ) {\n\tset_job_status( job_id.cluster, job_id.proc, REMOVED );\n\t}\nbreak;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-17 09:28:35 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm able to reproduce by removing the \"sleep 1\" and running &gt;30 jobs. Only the running jobs appear to be removed, which supports with Tim's theory.\n\n<p>This bug is possible from the beginning of time itself. A pain to track down due to numerous code reformattings.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">commit e36960755e96ac142669df746b95ed43a7111668\nAuthor: wright &lt;wright&gt;\nDate:   Thu Mar 15 21:48:08 2001 +0000\n\n    Fixed bug for condor_hold on NT (and any using of the new shadow).  If\n    the job we put on hold was running, we used to remove it from the\n    queue.  Now, in child_exit(), we check the status of the job in the\n    queue, and if it's HELD, we don't change the job status when the\n    shadow exits w/ JOB_KILLED, JOB_COREDUMPED, etc.  This insures that\n    check_zombie() won't remove the job from the queue.\n\ncommit 209f5873b9c08fe2d7ef7d837ff0f20b985deba9\nAuthor: adiel &lt;adiel&gt;\nDate:   Thu Feb 19 21:40:45 1998 +0000\n\n    Jobs that are killed/coredumped are set to status REMOVED instead of COMPLETED\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Before this the race would have show up as COMPLETED jobs, oops.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-17 10:06:22 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nSo making a simple switch to:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">case JOB_KILLED:\n\t// If the job isn't being HELD, we'll remove it\n\tif ( q_status != HELD &amp;&amp; q_status != IDLE ) {\n\tset_job_status( job_id.cluster, job_id.proc, REMOVED );\n\t}\nbreak;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>fixes this particular issue, but I wonder if it handles all.\n\n</p><p>So the question would be:\n\n</p><p>Is there ever a case where the shadow exits 102, +JOB is marked as idle, and  the job should be removed?
