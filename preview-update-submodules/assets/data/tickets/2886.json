{"id": 2886, "title": "Ticket #2886: Very high load on Condor-G machine reported by GlideinWMS", "description": "<blockquote>\nIgor Sfiligoi reports that when he upgraded the GlideinWMS glidein factory from Condor 7.6.2 to 7.6.6, things initially ran smoothly. But once they started submitting new glidein jobs, the load skyrocketed. He suspects it was IO-related. Downgrading back to 7.6.2 resolved the issue.\n\n<p>On March 15, Jaime Frey monitored an upgrade from 7.6.2 to 7.6.6 on the same machine. The load was a little higher after the upgrade, but did not incapacitate the machine like before.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:16", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Mar-12 16:28", "fixed_version": "2012-Mar-12 16:28", "broken_version": "v070606", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "s8144", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
