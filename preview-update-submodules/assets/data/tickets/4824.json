Anyhow, he reports that DIR on a splice requires that all output and error files still need to be given relative to the top-level directory.\n\n<p>In general, I think that splices and sub-DAGs should work as similarly as possible, so DIR on a splice should probably essentially add a DIR specification to every node in the splice.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-May-16 11:16", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jan-12 10:02", "fixed_version": "2015-Jan-12 10:02", "broken_version": "v080302", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu,zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
