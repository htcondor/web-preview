Note the lack of email.\n\n</p><p>The root problem here is the code in condor_utils in the shadow is checking to see if the shadow exit_code is set to JOB_SHOULD_HOLD, but this variable isn't passed in, and we just hard code -1.\n\n</p><p>There's also code for sending email when the job is released or removed.  I'm having a hard time coming up with a good use case for those, and suggest we remove that in another ticket.\n\n</p><p>I'm going to squeeze the balloon a little bit and force emailHold to alway set exit_code to JOB_SHOULD_HOLD, so we don't have to replumb this in stable, but this code needs a rethinking in master.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Jul-29 10:11:35 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>Code looks good.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Jul-29 15:43</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/1aeb89d8b7ef732db4f06099a95f0a537a803c79\">[60268]</a></span>: Document <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7763\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7763'); return false;\" title=\"notification = error doesn't send email when shadow holds the job\">#7763</a></span>  (By Greg Thain )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Jul-29 08:35</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/b034b1e5c93bab744ec59bc8db199af7335377b1\">[60265]</a></span>: Allow notification = error to send email on holds. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7763\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7763'); return false;\" title=\"notification = error doesn't send email when shadow holds the job\">#7763</a></span>  (By Greg Thain )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Jul-29 15:45", "status": "resolved", "created": "2020-Jul-29 08:35", "fixed_version": "2020-Jul-29 08:35", "broken_version": "v080800", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
