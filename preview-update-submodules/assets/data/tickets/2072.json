The Master provides another, which is used for HA Schedd\n setups.\n\n</p><p> That said, with the Credd storing date in the Windows registry, neither\n approach to HA will work.\n\n</p><p> Right now there are two Credd implementations. In the 7.7 timeframe\n they'll probably be merged and won't rely on the Windows register, which\n will make Master based HA possible.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Apr-20 07:45", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Apr-20 02:18", "fixed_version": "2011-Apr-20 02:18", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "afayolle", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
