Tons of old and irrelevant (and/or incorrect) stuff about the same topics should be removed.\n\n<p>Specifically for these tickets:\n\n</p><p><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7376\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7376'); return false;\" title=\"Add support for Kerberos and AFS creds for running job\">#7376</a></span> - Add support for Kerberos and AFS creds for running job\n\n</p><p><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7624\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7624'); return false;\" title=\"clean up client to CredD interface for user impersonation\">#7624</a></span> - clean up client to CredD interface for user impersonation\n\n</p><p><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7462\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7462'); return false;\" title=\"Different token types should be distinguished in the cred dir\">#7462</a></span> - Different token types should be distinguished in the cred dir\n\n</p><p><span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7484\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7484'); return false;\" title=\"oauth credentials are swept too quickly\">#7484</a></span> - oauth credentials are swept too quickly</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Dec-29 11:40:08 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nWhy was this ticket resolved?  A spot check of the documentation for AFS shows it is ancient and not updated.\n\n<p>This ticket has zero commits.  Any ticket marked as resolved with zero commits needs a comment about <strong>why</strong> it is being resolved, as it is not apparent that any of the work specified in this ticket actually happened.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Dec-29 12:31:32 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nMy guess is that tim saw that all the tickets mentioned in the description were resolved and then resolved this one.  However, this is a <strong>documentation</strong> ticket, specifically for those code change tickets.
