{"id": 1538, "title": "Ticket #1538: exponential backoff with job rescheduling", "description": "<blockquote>\nI have a context where I'd like X number of jobs submitted into a pool and they should only leave the queue with a certain exit code. No problem. However, something external to the jobs is adjusting something the jobs require to exit with an exit code of 0.\n\n<p>In the current incarnation of Condor, the schedd will try and reschedule all the jobs as fast as it can. What I want is a means by which I can implement an exponential backoff concerning a particular job to when it'll be scheduled next to stop the pressure in the pool to schedule jobs which might not be schedulable.\nThis is similar to deferring the job to run at a particular time, but I don't even want the job to be considered to scheduling until a particular amount of time in the future. I just want it to be ignored.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jul-27 14:40", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Jul-27 14:40", "fixed_version": "2010-Jul-27 14:40", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
