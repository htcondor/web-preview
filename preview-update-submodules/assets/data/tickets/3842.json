The user here was running a super-DAG with a whole bunch of sub-DAGs.  Partway through the run he wanted to change the config of the super-DAG slightly, so he condor_held all of his jobs and then condor_released them.  The weird thing is this:  all of the sub-DAGs submitted before the hold/release generated .dagman.log files, and all of the ones submitted after the hold/release did not(!).\n\n<p>The super-DAG still completed okay because it was using a nodes.log file to monitor its children.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Aug-09 13:27", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Aug-09 13:27", "fixed_version": "2013-Aug-09 13:27", "broken_version": "v080001", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
