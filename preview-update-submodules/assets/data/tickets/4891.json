I believe that came from a Red Hat collaborator, but it could have been from official packaging guidelines. That would require an RPATH even for proper builds.\nBut I see that both Fedora and OSG put libcondor_utils_X_X_X.so in /usr/lib[64], making the RPATH unnecessary for proper builds. We still need it for UW builds with externals.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Mar-13 15:45:17 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nWe define a cmake option called CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH to control whether to set the RPATH. It defaults to setting the RPATH on linux. We could change the default to not set the RPATH for proper builds. And the OSG build could set it explicitly to not set the RPATH.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Apr-22 15:16:03 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nPer TimT on OSG/HTCondor call: should easily make it to 8.3.6.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-May-06 15:14:36 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nPer TimT, this should be finished before code freeze.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-May-08 11:44:29 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nNo version needed.
