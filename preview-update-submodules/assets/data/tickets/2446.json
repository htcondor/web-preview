{"id": 2446, "title": "Ticket #2446: Propagate log reader errors up to top level", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight now, there can be errors in the log file reading code that are never propagated up to the DAGMan level.  For example, we have just run into the case where we get the following error: \"ReadUserLog::initialize: error re-opening file\".  Unfortunately, that happens inside a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ReadUserLog\" title=\"Read User Log\">ReadUserLog</a></span> constructor, so no error indication get passed back to higher levels.  (We might be able to figure out that something went wrong by checking the value returned by isInitialized() (I'd have to check whether it correctly indicates a problem in this case.)\n\n<p>Also, I wonder if we might want to have any log file reading error be fatal in DAGMan (maybe that should be configurable).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Sep-08 14:25", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Sep-08 14:25", "fixed_version": "2011-Sep-08 14:25", "broken_version": "v070701", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
