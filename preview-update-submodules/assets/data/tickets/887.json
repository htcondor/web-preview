{"id": 887, "title": "Ticket #887: edit section 3.6.11 (User Accounts in Condor)", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis section attempts to answer the questions: Why should I run various Condor daemons as root?  And which ones should be run as root?  It hasn't been edited in centuries, and is incredibly verbose for what it explains.  With new installation instructions, this section is probably mostly obsolete. Further, it perhaps is misleading when privsep possibilities are taken into account.  Therefore, a revision is in order, and now with this ticket, a revision is on order. . .</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2014-Mar-06 10:23", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Oct-27 15:14", "fixed_version": "2009-Oct-27 15:14", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "#672", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
