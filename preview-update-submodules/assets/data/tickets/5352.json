Safari doesn't respect the download attribute and insists on viewing it directly; clumsy, but you can save the resulting view.  As best I can tell, there is no pure client-side Javascript solution.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Nov-03 10:55", "status": "resolved", "created": "2015-Oct-28 15:48", "fixed_version": "2015-Oct-28 15:48", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "#5351", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
