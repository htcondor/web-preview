I am\nbasically a Windows guy with very little knowledge of Linux\\Unix, . If\nyou guys were to include example for windows pools with batch files,\netc;  I would have been easier to understand the application and how to\nuse it.\"</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Aug-15 16:00:39 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nMost of our examples, either in the Manual or in the HOWTOs of the wiki, come from our own operational pools at UW.
