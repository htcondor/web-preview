{"id": 5455, "title": "Ticket #5455: HTCondor View: Fix edit and fullscreen for multi-URL charts", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe edit and fullscreen pages aren't prepared to cope with charts that are drawing from multiple URLs. They both expect a singular URL.  Also, they have no comprehension of date ranges, so given a URL like \"data/submitters.weekly..json\", they don't know how to expand it.\n\n<p>There are two possible solutions\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Option 1: edit/fullscreen should support multiple URLs</h2>\n\n<p>1. Teach edit.html and fullscreen.html that there might be multiple URLs and to preserve them all. This may require an HTCondorView API change to allow data_url to be a list. That will require changes at several layers (and might forbid using date range expansion in this case? It could be made to work, but seems silly.).\n\n</p><p>2. Teach HTCondorView that links to edit and fullscreen should include all URLs used.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Option 2: edit/fullscreen should support date ranges</h2>\n\n<p>1. Teach edit.html and fullscreen.html to accept and use date ranges. Hopefully a relatively shallow change limited to edit and fullscreen.\n\n</p><p>2. Teach HTCondorView that links to edit and fullscreen should include the date ranges if present.\n\n</p><p>Option 2 is probably easier and arguably more clear about intent.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Dec-23 17:21:24 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nGoing with option 2. fullscreen already fixed.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Jan-04 13:20:29 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nFixed edit.
