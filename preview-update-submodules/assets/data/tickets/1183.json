{"id": 1183, "title": "Ticket #1183: Comments in classad regexes aren't real useful; fix docs.", "description": "<blockquote>\nOur documentation for the <strong>regexp</strong> classad functions says:\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nX or x\n Ignore both white space and comments within the pattern. A comment is defined by starting with the pound sign (#) character, and continuing until the newline character.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\nHowever, you can't practically get a newline into a classad value in Condor.  So the comments are useless. We can't simply omit the documentation, since users need to know that they need to escape #.  One option is to omit documentation of the \"x\" option entirely; what's the value if the only thing you can do is add ignored spaces and tabs.  (It's more useful if you can add ignored newlines.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Jun-22 10:54:48 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nI don't know what I was thinking about the need to escape # marks.  You shouldn't need to unless you're using \"x\", and we don't want users using \"x\".  The documentation in question has been removed, so this is resolved.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jul-31 11:58:04 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nAlan, what version of the doc was update?
