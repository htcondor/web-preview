Is there an NMI build ID / URL with the test results?\n\n</p><p>Another issue is was the <code>job_ligo_x86-64-chkpttst-1</code> test from the test suite pass on Debian 7?  This tests a primary LIGO application in standard universe. Looks like it has only ever run on RHEL5, but I would really want to see it green on Debian7.\n\n</p><p>Thanks\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jul-03 15:11:18 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>&gt; Before I go any further on the code review, where I can see the results of the\n&gt; regression test suite against this branch?

For comparison, the dashboard as the \"ultra-clipped\" daily results going back to Monday afternoon.
