There are several different code paths that emit the same error message (See src/condor_startd.V6/command.cpp and src/condor_startd.V6/util.cpp), so if you see this error in an error message, you're not sure which path it was, or what command was received.  I'd debugging a problem where I'm seeing a spat of these error messages for different <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClaimIds\" title=\"Claim Ids\">ClaimIds</a></span> and I can't explain why. I'm going to ask the user to turn on D_COMMAND, but this adds another round trip by email and a delay while he waits for the problem to reoccur.\n\n<p>Improvement: log the command, ideally by name, but even number would be good, for all of these messages.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Apr-13 17:52:20 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nIf the logs are available that would likely be beneficial, b/c it usually contains crumbs as to the source of entry.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Apr-16 14:15:26 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nImplemented for 7.5.3.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Apr-16 14:13</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/8ea236a83704ca2935d4780f1efc25e2c74a6d0c\">[17873]</a></span>: When the startd ignores a command because it can't find the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClaimId\" title=\"Claim Id\">ClaimId</a></span>, it logs a warning to the log.
