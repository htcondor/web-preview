{"id": 1779, "title": "Ticket #1779: Incorrect description of developers of the CREAM software", "description": "<blockquote>\nOne of the developers of CREAM, Massimo Sgaravatto, contacted me about an incorrect attribution in the Condor manual. He wrote:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>In COndor Manual, I see (section 5.3.8 of 7.5 manual):\n\nCREAM is a job submission interface being developed by EGEE at Cern ...\n\nCould you please replace Cern with INFN ?\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Could you please make this fix in whatever manuals are appropriate? (7.4? 7.5?) Also, please double-check if it happens anywhere else we discuss CREAM. It might seem small, but it's the kind of detail that can annoy collaborators.\n\n</p><p>Thank you so much!!</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nFrom Karen:  fixed in the 7.4.4 branch of the manual, and it will be carried forward by merges to other manuals.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2010-Nov-18 14:58", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Nov-18 11:04", "fixed_version": "2010-Nov-18 11:04", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "roy", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "roy@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
