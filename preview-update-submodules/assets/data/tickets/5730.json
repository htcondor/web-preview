{"id": 5730, "title": "Ticket #5730: Make node job ClassAd visible to DAGMan POST script", "description": "<blockquote>\nMiron today expressed a desire to have a node job's <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> visible to its POST script.  (I didn't think of this during our discussion, but the POST script can access the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> via condor_history.  I'm not sure if that would satisfy what Miron wants or not.)\n\n<p>I'd have to think about what a good way would be to do this -- the first thing that comes to mind is that we could have a $(CLASSAD_FILE) argument to the post script, and DAGMan would write a file with the relevant <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span>, and fill in the file name as the argument.  (One issue with that is garbage-collecting the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> files.)\n\n</p><p>(One problem with using condor_history is that it may not work real well for node jobs with multiple procs.  If we did the file method, I guess the file could contain the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> for <strong>all</strong> of the procs, so that might work a little better.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jun-14 15:36", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jun-14 15:36", "fixed_version": "2016-Jun-14 15:36", "broken_version": "v080505", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, miron@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
