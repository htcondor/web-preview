If it's not possible, we probably don't need to initialize draining.\n\n</p><p>While I like the idea of p-slots, any user that puts in for a high-memory job on a busy cluster (read: all clusters that I know about), their job just seems to starve.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2012-May-14 21:39", "status": "new", "created": "2012-May-14 21:39", "fixed_version": "2012-May-14 21:39", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
