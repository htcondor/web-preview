{"id": 5002, "title": "Ticket #5002: MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH should have access to the job ad", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe configuration variable <code>MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH</code> should (optionally) be allowed to be a classad expression instead of a simple list of directories.  If it is an expression, the it should be evaluated in the context of a job ad, the result of the evaluation should be a string that the starter will use as a list of directories.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Apr-13 19:49:41 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nTodd and I had discussed this a few weeks back.  A few thoughts that came up since then:\n<ul>\n<li>Traditionally in Unix, allowing users to muck around with filesystem mounts is considered a security bug (as they can fool setuid binaries -- think of what fun could be had if the user could overwrite /etc/sudoers.d).  How can we validate this is a safe action?\n<ul>\n<li>Linux's solution to this was PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS (see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"review\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4443\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4443'); return false;\" title=\"Allow sysadmins to enable PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS\">#4443</a></span>)\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Is there a way to add this without introducing a new config knob?  I couldn't think of any...\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Apr-14 10:29:05 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nThe proposed implementation does not allow the job to set mounts directly. but a badly written STARTD config could potentially allow them to.\n\n<p>We were thinking that the use case is something like this.\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH = IfThenElse(Owner=?=\"Special\", \"/tmp\", \"/tmp,/mnt/shared\")\n</pre>\n\n<p>to deny non-special jobs access to the shared filesystem.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Apr-14 14:25:42 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nAfter some discussion with ZKM, we have decided to go forward with the current design.  It's true that a sloppy STARTD configuration could result in jobs injecting mount points, but we don't anticipate that normal use of the feature will pose any risk.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Jun-02 16:07</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/53176770bbfd7c74942e16be5111b83f791b4fe3\">[44937]</a></span>: Minor 8.3.6 version history item edit <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5002\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5002'); return false;\" title=\"MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH should have access to the job ad\">#5002</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Jun-02 14:55</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/bb398eb3b6a997e9165213478304cc51dedea598\">[44932]</a></span>: Version history and doc for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5002\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5002'); return false;\" title=\"MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH should have access to the job ad\">#5002</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5004\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5004'); return false;\" title=\"Allow ASSIGN_CPU_AFFINITY to be an expression against the job ad\">#5004</a></span>, and <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5025\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5025'); return false;\" title=\"condor_history should permit multiple jobid's and constraints\">#5025</a></span>  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Apr-14 14:16</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/4cfa0d04da3fec9805c307e1de7a71a6ef559618\">[44605]</a></span>: allow MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH to be an expression against the job ad. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5002\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5002'); return false;\" title=\"MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH should have access to the job ad\">#5002</a></span> this commit also moves auto_free_ptr (for freeing param returns) to common code ===VersionHistory:Pending===  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Jun-02 14:58", "status": "resolved", "created": "2015-Apr-13 16:09", "fixed_version": "2015-Apr-13 16:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
