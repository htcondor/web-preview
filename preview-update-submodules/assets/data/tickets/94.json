{"id": 94, "title": "Ticket #94: gridmanager mishandles gram error 156", "description": "<blockquote>\nGram error 156 (JOB_CONTACT_NOT_FOUND) occurs when a client tries to contact a jobmanager but their job ids don&amp;#8217;t match. This can happen when the jobmanager the client was talking to exits and a jobmanager for a different job is started and binds to the same port.\n\n<p>When the gridmanage sees this error, it treats it like most other errors, first sending a STOP_JM message, then sending a cancel command, then putting the job on hold in the schedd. Instead, it should try to restart the jobmanager.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 13:59", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-23 16:50", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-23 16:50", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
