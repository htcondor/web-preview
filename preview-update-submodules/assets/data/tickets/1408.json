ShadowMgr which deals with\n    the SHADOW_LIST config file setting.  at startup and reconfig it\n    spawns all the shadows specified there (for backwards compatibility,\n    if SHADOW_LIST isn't defined it just tries all the old names that\n    might be in your config file) with the -classad option, and grabs\n    their classads.  it is responsible for finding a Shadow object that\n    matches a given job's needs when the schedd needs to spawn a shadow.\n    This stuff is based heavily on the StarterMgr and Starter objects in\n    the startd, so if you fix anything here, you should check there, too.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>commit cfb0c0eb5d6da5729caa4def18462627280895ae\nAuthor: wright &lt;wright&gt;\nDate:   Fri Apr 19 20:41:27 2002 +0000\n\n    a few more changes to help w/ supporting old config files:\n    - dprintf a warning if we discover an old config file to encourage\n      people to fix theirs to the new way (only print it once).\n    - if we're dealing w/ an old file, we're not going to find the new\n      condor_starter.std binary which we now ship.  so, special-case that\n      one and search in SBIN for it.\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-May-15 12:24</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/d96ec4faa43d3e6911121dd8102ccfc724948d11\">[18009]</a></span>: Removed param for SBIN and fixed up code for config files that include STARTER_LIST (true since 2002) (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1408\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1408'); return false;\" title='Purge code for supporting \"old\" config files (STARTER/SHADOW_LIST)'>#1408</a></span>)  (By Matthew Farrellee )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-May-15 12:21</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/591627970cf9e3a38f34403bc24d5420e5ed0aea\">[18008]</a></span>: Removed param for SBIN and fixed up code for config files that include SHADOW_LIST (true since 2002) (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1408\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1408'); return false;\" title='Purge code for supporting \"old\" config files (STARTER/SHADOW_LIST)'>#1408</a></span>)  (By Matthew Farrellee )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-May-15 12:28", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-May-15 11:50", "fixed_version": "2010-May-15 11:50", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "matt", "derived_from": "", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
