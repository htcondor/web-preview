It has separate queues (globus jobmanagers) for linux and windows jobs. The linux queue works well, but in the windows queue, jobs fail to execute at the startd:\n\n===============================================================\n06/18 22:22:08 Starting a VANILLA universe job with ID: 37.0\n06/18 22:22:09 Tracking process family by login \"condor-reuse-slot1\"\n06/18 22:22:09 IWD: C:\\Progra~1\\Condor\\execute\\dir_428\n06/18 22:22:09 Output file: C:\\Progra~1\\Condor\\execute\\dir_428\\_condor_stdout\n06/18 22:22:10 Error file: C:\\Progra~1\\Condor\\execute\\dir_428\\_condor_stderr\n06/18 22:22:10 Renice expr \"10\" evaluated to 10\n06/18 22:22:10 About to exec C:\\Progra~1\\Condor\\execute\\dir_428\\condor_exec.gass_cache/local/md5/32/4a5afa0e96a19fa2244e8dd70116ce/md5/f4/91c2ba79ec192a3e127340f8999f71/data\n06/18 22:22:10 GetExecutableAndArgumentsByExtention: failed to find extension *.gass_cache/local/md5/32/4a5afa0e96a19fa2244e8dd70116ce/md5/f4/91c2ba79ec192a3e127340f8999f71/data in the registry (last-error =\n2).\n06/18 22:22:10 Create_Process(): Failed to find an executable for extension *.gass_cache/local/md5/32/4a5afa0e96a19fa2244e8dd70116ce/md5/f4/91c2ba79ec192a3e127340f8999f71/data\n06/18 22:22:10 ERROR: C:\\Progra~1\\Condor\\execute\\dir_428\\condor_exec.gass_cache\\local\\md5\\32\\4a5afa0e96a19fa2244e8dd70116ce\\md5\\f4\\91c2ba79ec192a3e127340f8999f71\\data.exe is not a valid Windows executable\n06/18 22:22:10 ERROR \"Create_Process(C:\\Progra~1\\Condor\\execute\\dir_428\\condor_exec.gass_cache/local/md5/32/4a5afa0e96a19fa2244e8dd70116ce/md5/f4/91c2ba79ec192a3e127340f8999f71/data,, ...) failed: \" at line\n530 in file ..\\src\\condor_starter.V6.1\\os_proc.cpp\n06/18 22:22:10 ShutdownFast all jobs.\n===============================================================\n\nThe gass_cache part should not be there.. if I understand correctly, condor-g uses gass internally to transfer files to the gt5 resource, but once they are there and a condor_submit is generated, condor's own file transfer mechanism kicks in and the startd should never see the cache url?
