{"id": 2616, "title": "Ticket #2616: Create a command-line tool to communicate with DAGMan", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight now the user can basically communicate with a running DAGMan only via the condor_rm and condor_hold commands, and we (Pete and I) think that this is too coarse-grained.  (A couple of examples -- on condor_rm, should a final node be run or not, and should a rescue DAG be created, or should things just be killed off as quickly as possible; and, on a condor_hold, should the DAGMan job actually be killed, or should it be told to just stop submitting node jobs.)\n\n<p>There are plenty of other possibilities, too, such as querying the state of the DAG.\n\n</p><p>We're thinking that this should be a new command-line tool, like condor_dag_tool or something.  Since DAGMan is daemoncore, it has a command socket; it could put the address for that into its classad, and then the DAG tool could get the address from the schedd, and talk to DAGMan directly after that.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Nov-07 16:45:23 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThis tool should also be able to change configuration settings for DAGMan (e.g., maxjobs).

Then, if we finish successfully, we remove the rescue DAG file.  I think that might work for both rescue and recovery modes, although I need to do a little more thinking to make sure that it would work for recovery mode.  Also note that we might not need to record all commands -- for example, if a command is to do a reconfig, any changes to the config file(s) would take effect automatically in recovery or rescue mode anyhow.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Oct-30 18:25:07 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, probably the most obvious use for this would be changing parameters like maxjobs on the fly...</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2831\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2831'); return false;\" title='Be able to \"manually\" retry nodes during a DAG run'>#2831</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nBe able to \"manually\" retry nodes during a DAG run</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Oct-30 18:25", "status": "defer", "created": "2011-Nov-04 12:39", "fixed_version": "2011-Nov-04 12:39", "broken_version": "v070702", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#2810", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu,bbockelm@cse.unl.edu, anderson@ligo.caltech.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
