That script has a big comment that comprises the documentation.  It helpfully describes how it interacts with CVS and makes heavy use of the idea of CVS modules.  This is obviously nonsensical in the new git world.  It's not clear what some settings should be set to as a result.  This needs updating.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 17:27", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Oct-14 12:05", "fixed_version": "2009-Oct-14 12:05", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
