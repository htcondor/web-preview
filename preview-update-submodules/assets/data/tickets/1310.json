This method should leverage the functionality provided by the pre-existing function <code>directory.cpp:temp_dir_path()</code>, as it seems like these two methods do very similar work.  Lets have this logic in just one place if possible (and if impossible, a comment explaining why).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Aug-17 19:40:45 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nWill you make the point where locks are consolidated configurable?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Aug-19 17:11:06 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nIn the preen code, there's the following new code\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">+                       while( (file = files-&gt;Next()) &amp;&amp; i &lt; 65536) {\n+                               if(! files-&gt;IsDirectory() ) {\n+                                       const char *path = files-&gt;GetFullPath();\n\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Should that 2nd and 3rd \"files\" be \"file\"?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Aug-26 13:11:22 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nAlso, is NEW_LOCKING defined in the param table?

We can certainly do that -- at the time I considered it a cleaner approach to not do it, though. Comments on that appreciated. If we decided to stick to the function, I can gladly add a comment in the code why the decision was made to add an additional function for a similar job.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Sep-02 17:38:59 by cweiss:</em> <br/>\n\n@Greg's comment: Nope, both should in fact be \"files\".

We don't really ever have the scenario where multiple users (effective UID) write to the same file (as discussed with Todd). Thus it makes sense to have the eUID in there. Additionally, go back to stripping the file's hash value mod 10000, use that value as the first directory value, and then the eUID as a directory value. This will limit the number of directories created to 10000 * number of UIDs.
