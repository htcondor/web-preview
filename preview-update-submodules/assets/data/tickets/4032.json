{"id": 4032, "title": "Ticket #4032: Add $(RETRY) to VARS options in DAGMan", "description": "<blockquote>\nBrian Bockelman wanted to have output files from his job named by the retry.  He can do this indirectly by renaming them with a POST script, but it would be easier and more elegant to allow $(RETRY) to be passed as a VARS value, so it could be used in the submit file and you wouldn't have to do the renaming.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Nov-04 08:30:49 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nIt would actually be useful to have both the $(RETRY) available to VARS <strong>and</strong> have it available in the job ad.\n\n<p>Most users would likely only use VARS, but I have use cases for both.  $(RETRY) would be useful for renaming stdout but various job monitoring systems would like to be able to query the ad for the retry name.\n\n</p><p>(Changing customer group to CMS as that's where the use cases are coming from.)\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-04 11:40:43 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, this should be pretty easy to do (both VARS and classad attribute) -- I'm going to bump it up to priority 3...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-18 10:54:01 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi,\n\n<p>Can I bump this ticket?

How critical is that for you?
