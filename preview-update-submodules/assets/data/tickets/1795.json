It appears that the machine is being fork-bombed. I see many 'make' processes owned by sl1-user running, and all virtual memory exhausted. It appears that said job was submitted from nmi-s006, I'm doing some more digging.\n\n<p>It's definitely Condor build jobs. The one that was running when it went down last was associated with run 294162, which is a build of tag trunk-2010-11-28.\n\n</p><p>Looks like it happened again last night, too.
