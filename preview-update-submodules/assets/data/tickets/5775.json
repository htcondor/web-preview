{"id": 5775, "title": "Ticket #5775: OOM killed all jobs in htcondor cgroup rather than offending job", "description": "<blockquote>\nBelow are a bunch of logs from Tom at LIGO showing strange behavior with cgroups, where jobs that are well below there memory limit were being targeted by the OOM and thus put on hold by HTCondor.  After investigation, it turns out that if memory use_hierarchy is 1, then hitting the limit at the parent notifies all children, even if those children are below their usage.  The upshot we think when LIGO put all of htcondor into a cgroup hierarchy, and some other process outside of the HTCondor hierarchy on the machine exhausted memory, the OOM typically picked a HTCondor job to be killed (because we set the OOM priorites that way, to ensure jobs get killed before HTConnor daemons).\n\n<p>Obviously having HTCondor put jobs on hold due to memory when the jobs were not using anything close to their requested_memory is undesired.  Our approach to improve this situation is to add a boolean config knob, <code>IGNORE_LEAF_OOM</code>.  If set to True, upon notification from the OOM, the starter will check how much memory the job is using.  If the job is using more memory than allocated, the job is killed and put on hold as before.  But if the job us using less memory than allocated, the starter will then ignore the notification from the OOM and continue to let the job run.  Hopefully, some other process will be killed, and when it does, the job will get unfrozen and continue to run.\n\n</p><p>As a next step, if this approach works well in testing, we should a) set IGNORE_LEAF_OOM to True by default in the param table, and b) setup a more reasonable default for MEMORY that understands HTCondor cannot allocate all physical RAM - some must be set aside for the system OS and/or a few typical system services that are common on execute nodes(like monitoring, puppet, etc).\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"restricted\"><hr/></div><em>Reported by Tom from LIGO:</em>\n\n<p>It looks to me like 1 job greatly exceeded its memory request and took down a number of other jobs that were respecting their memory request.\n\n</p><p>Is this Condor-intended behavior? Is it a consequence of my use of memory.use_hierarchy - the only way I know of to cap total Condor consumption before it uses all of RAM? If so, do you know of a way of guiding the OOM killer to target offending jobs within a hierarchy first? This is the first I've noticed a problem like this so it might be the case that the offending job in slot1_6 was so offensive that the OOM killer started killing everything in sight.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>/usr/bin/cgcreate -g blkio,cpu,cpuacct,freezer,memory:htcondor -a root:root -t root:root\n/usr/bin/cgset -r cpu.shares=1000 htcondor\n/usr/bin/cgset -r memory.use_hierarchy=1 htcondor\n/usr/bin/cgset -r memory.limit_in_bytes=${CONDOR_MEMORY_LIMIT_RAM}M htcondor\n/usr/bin/cgset -r memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes=${CONDOR_MEMORY_LIMIT_SWAP_RAM}M htcondor\n/usr/bin/cgset -r memory.swappiness=0 htcondor\n\n/var/log/condor/StarterLog.slot1_1:07/01/16 09:29:32 (pid:1682733) Job was held due to OOM event: Job has gone over memory limit of 7168 megabytes.
