{"id": 5479, "title": "Ticket #5479: Allow user to define failure for DAG node jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nMiron wants users to be able to define (at the DAG level) what constitutes failure for a DAG node job (as opposed to the current semantics that any non-zero exit code is a failure).\n\n<p>The user should be able to specify a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> expression (first globally, then with the capability to override it for individual nodes).  (The first step is just hard-coding an expression that matches the current semantics, just to exercise the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> evaluation code within DAGMan.)\n\n</p><p>One other issue is how this should apply to PRE and POST scripts -- should the same expression apply to them, or do they each need their own expression?  My initial thought is that there should just be a single expression that applies to the PRE script, HTCondor job, and POST script.\n\n</p><p>Also, another question (just syntactic) is whether this should be defined in terms of <strong>failure</strong> or <strong>success</strong>.\n\n</p><p>Part of the motivation for this is to make it explicit if a non-zero exit code constitutes \"success\", as opposed to \"hiding\" that semantic in the POST script.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jan-14 12:31", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jan-14 12:23", "fixed_version": "2016-Jan-14 12:23", "broken_version": "v080501", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, miron@cs.wisc.edu, zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
