In <em>theory</em> it should not matter since the GRAM interface in Globus is supposedly non-blocking, but in <em>practice</em> we'd sleep better at night. ;-)\n\n</p><p>Thus, we'd like an option for the schedd to start a new gridmanager instance based upon a tuple of both submitter UID and remote destination.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-May-15 07:26:23 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSo a great idea regarding this (credit to Jaime): have a classad expression in the config file return a string that will be used as a hash value.
