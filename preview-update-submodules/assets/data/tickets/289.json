{"id": 289, "title": "Ticket #289: my_full_hostname() and Daemon::fullHostname() disagree on hostnames.", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom the looks of it, my_full_hostname() and Daemon::fullHostname() disagree on hostnames in some cases. It seems like they could share more code than they do, which would ensure that if they are getting the wrong host name, at least they can agree on the wrong name.  Still, it is not clear to me that this is a Condor problem, or an incorrectly configured DNS problem.\n\n<p>This only seems to be happening on Windows machines, so there may be some local configuration problems as well (i.e. a hosts files is searched first for some reason, etc.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Mar-02 10:51:01 by burnett:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=288\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('288'); return false;\" title=\"Port collision not noticed by condor daemons in windows\">#288</a></span>:\n\n<p>It seems that this may be a DNS problem (or how we seem to break whilst using it):\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  02/27 23:14:02 Looking for matching Collector on 'nmi-0226.batlab.cs.wisc.edu'...\n  02/27 23:14:02 Found 'nmi-0226.cs.wisc.edu:0'\n</pre>\n\n<p>Somehow, in this instance, on Windows, the master decides it is called nmi-0226.batlab.cs.wisc.edu but when it goes looking for a collector by the same name, the only one it finds is nmi-0226.cs.wisc.edu.
