My original theory was that the schedd could split that, however I had forgotten that I designed consumption policies to operate consistently across the negotiator and startd.  So the initial negotiator match obtains its claim, that represents all the resource assets.  The schedd has no problem attempting to further allocate leftovers, however there <strong>are</strong> no leftovers, as the first job acquires them all with its claim.\n\n</p><p>The first test did demonstrate that nothing pathological happens.  It just means that the negotiator will tend to acquire the matches/claim first, and the schedd will generally have nothing further to do in that case.\n\n</p><p>However, I did do a further test where I declared two startds.  Each startd has a p-slot, but only one has a consumption policy, and the other operates in traditional mode.  This test demonstrates that the system can operate in \"mixed pool\" mode, where some startds advertise traditional slots, and others can advertise slots with consumption policies, and the system correctly handles both.\n\n</p><p>the configuration was:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\"># spoof some cores\nNUM_CPUS = 5\n\nSTARTD.ST1.STARTD_LOG = $(LOG)/Startd_1_Log\nSTARTD.ST1.STARTD_NAME = st1\nSTARTD.ST1.ADDRESS_FILE = $(LOG)/.startd_1_address\nSTARTD_ST1_ARGS = -f -local-name ST1\nSTARTD_ST1 = $(STARTD)\n\nSTARTD.ST2.STARTD_LOG = $(LOG)/Startd_2_Log\nSTARTD.ST2.STARTD_NAME = st2\nSTARTD.ST2.ADDRESS_FILE = $(LOG)/.startd_2_address\nSTARTD_ST2_ARGS = -f -local-name ST2\nSTARTD_ST2 = $(STARTD)\n\nUSE_PROCD = FALSE\nDAEMON_LIST = MASTER, COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR, SCHEDD, STARTD_ST1, STARTD_ST2\n\n# configure an aggregate resource (p-slot) to consume\nSLOT_TYPE_1 = 100%\nSLOT_TYPE_1_PARTITIONABLE = True\n# declare multiple claims for negotiator to use\n# may also use global: NUM_CLAIMS\nSLOT_TYPE_1_NUM_CLAIMS = 20\nNUM_SLOTS_TYPE_1 = 1\n\n# turn on schedd-side claim splitting to test with a consumption policy\nCLAIM_PARTITIONABLE_LEFTOVERS = True\n\n# turn this off to demonstrate that consumption policy will handle this kind of logic\nMUST_MODIFY_REQUEST_EXPRS = False\n\n# configure a consumption policy.

This is bad because a Claim is a heavy object. But it's use here is merely used as a holder for a ClaimId.id() for publication/comparison and later insertion into the current Claim object. Use of Claim here is here is dangerous because methods in the Claim object can call get_by_any_id() in the <code>ResMgr</code> object which can delete a Claim object depending on what ID is passed.

It will be better to leave the type of <code>ClaimIdHash</code> alone and allow the right hand side to be the same as the contents of ATTR_CLAIM_ID_LIST. Many of the changes in the matchmaker exist only to account for the unnecessary change of the type of <code>ClaimIdHash</code>.  This will also make changes to the matchmaker a bit more localized.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-13 16:20:38 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nsummary of some email discussion:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>&gt;    +The r_claims member of the Resource object it still a set of Claim()\n&gt;    objects rather than a =StringList= of claim ids. This is bad because a\n&gt;    Claim is a heavy object. But it's use here is merely used as a holder for\n&gt;    a ClaimId.id() for publication/comparison and later insertion into the\n&gt;    current Claim object.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Although claims are \"heavy\", they aren't enormous (my estimate was a few kB), and there aren't a very large number of them.  It defaults to the number of cores, and in general represents the maximum number of expected jobs to be running on a machine.  If <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3435\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3435'); return false;\" title=\"negotiator-side resource consumption with consumption policies\">#3435</a></span> isn't enabled, r_claims is empty.   My chief motivation for doing the way I did was that it works using the current conventions and machinery -- that is, a slot stores its claim structure(s), and an incoming claim request initiates a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ResMgr\" title=\"Res Mgr\">ResMgr</a></span> search over {slots}X{claims} for the one that matches the incoming request.  So doing it this way only required a localized gengeralization to (optionally) searching an additional source of claims: r_claims.  The fix on <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3792\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3792'); return false;\" title=\"Claim handling for consumption policies causes crash in startd\">#3792</a></span> just cleaned up the logic to make sure that the same claim doesn't reside on both r_claims and r_cur simultaneously.  Although this can induce a situation where claims could get constructed/destructed that aren't ever used, it's not something that happens frequently, or in a tight inner loop.  The impact is small, and only happens if one wants to use the new consumption policy feature.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>&gt;    +changes to slot_builder.cpp and resattributes.h serve no purpose that I\n&gt;    can determine.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The purpose of those mods was to enable slots constructed with zero-valued resource assets.  It's a feature of consumption policies that, since different resources can drive the policy depending on configuration, other resources may be zero, and never be consumed.  (This property is also exercised on the <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3435\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3435'); return false;\" title=\"negotiator-side resource consumption with consumption policies\">#3435</a></span> regression tests).\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>&gt;    +The change of =ClaimIdHash= from a =HashTable= to a map of sets is also\n&gt;    gratituous.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>To support multiple matches against a single slot, it was necessary to generalize the rhs of the mapping to contain multiple claims.  Since I had to modify the structure definition, I just took the opportunity to migrate to a standard STL container while I was doing it.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>&gt; It's the CURRENT claim object that that is being\n&gt; destroyed there.   The state machine that is the STARTD is very complex,\n&gt; so it's important to write code that doesn't make too many assumptions\n&gt; about calling order.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The reason this works cleanly is that for p-slots, r_cur doesn't actually represent a live claim.  Instead, r_cur is handed off to a d-slot, and the d-slot is the actual holder of that claim.  Then r_cur is replaced with a new claim-structure on the p-slot, in preparation for the next claim request.  Effectively, I just added another bucket of claims that a p-slot can hand off to the d-slot.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Oct-10 17:42:17 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSquash commit into master for v8.1.2.
