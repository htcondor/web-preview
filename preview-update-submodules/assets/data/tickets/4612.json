We report the number of unique auto-cluster numbers.  However, each auto-cluster is only unique within the same owner.  For example, if ToddT and BrianB both have 1 auto-cluster in the schedd, there would be 1 auto-cluster reported (as opposed to 2).\n\n</p><p>This effectively prevents us from monitoring auto clusters.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2014-Sep-26 12:55", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Sep-25 08:48", "fixed_version": "2014-Sep-25 08:48", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#4490", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
