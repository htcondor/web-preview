Note, adding \"executable = /usr/bin/env\" still results in both jobs running in local.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Oct-22 10:34:31 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nThis should be better documented at the very least, or prohibited by condor_submit if it's always a bad idea.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Oct-23 11:26:37 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nYes, we should add an explicit check and error-out into condor_submit for this, the universe is the <strong>first</strong> thing that condor_submit looks at when interpreting the submit file and that can change the way it looks at all of the other submit keywords.\n\n<p>Because of standard universe, when the executable changes, condor_submit essentially does a reset of it's internal parsing state because the schedd requires that an executable be unique to a cluster id.  Standard universe is going away in 8.9, so this hack will also (probably) go away.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-Oct-23 11:26", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Oct-18 14:56", "fixed_version": "2019-Oct-18 14:56", "broken_version": "v080805", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "anderson", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "leo.p.singer@nasa.gov", "due_date": ""}
