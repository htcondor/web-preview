{"id": 1712, "title": "Ticket #1712: rotate instead of truncating node job user logs?", "description": "<blockquote>\nMaybe DAGMan should rotate, instead of truncating, node job user log files when it monitors one for the first time (the real solution would be to add a way to correctly associate events with a given DAGMan instance, so we wouldn't have to remove old events from the logs at all).  Anyhow, Pegasus just ran into a situation where we couldn't get some info we needed because the relevant part of a log file was truncated...  (Maybe there should be a config knob for whether to do this, and how many old versions to keep.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Oct-14 09:38", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Oct-14 09:38", "fixed_version": "2010-Oct-14 09:38", "broken_version": "v070504", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
