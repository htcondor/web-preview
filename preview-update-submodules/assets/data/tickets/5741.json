{"id": 5741, "title": "Ticket #5741: Improve error reporting in queue-management interface", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen a request that's part of the schedd's queue-management interface fails, the client given an error core, but no message as to why it failed. If the client is using the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=NoAck\" title=\"No Ack\">NoAck</a></span> flag, then they just see a closed connection, with no idea which part of their set of requests failed.\n\n<p>We now support returning an error message in response to a failed <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CommitTransaction\" title=\"Commit Transaction\">CommitTransaction</a></span>. This was added for SUBMIT_REQUIREMENTS. We could use that to return error messages for failures that precede the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CommitTransaction\" title=\"Commit Transaction\">CommitTransaction</a></span>.\n\n</p><p>Ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5734\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5734'); return false;\" title=\"Nonexistent owners cause problems in schedd\">#5734</a></span> has a patch attachment that does this for the Owner check added there. It was deemed too risky for the stable series.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Jun-21 14:02", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Jun-21 09:50", "fixed_version": "2016-Jun-21 09:50", "broken_version": "v080400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5734", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
