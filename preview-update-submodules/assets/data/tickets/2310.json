{"id": 2310, "title": "Ticket #2310: WHEN_TO_TRANSFER_OUTPUT=NEVER", "description": "<blockquote>\nBased on Ian Chesal's message <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/condor-devel/2011-July/msg00011.shtml\">https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/condor-devel/2011-July/msg00011.shtml</a>\n\n<p>Proposal: Add NEVER as a valid option for WHEN_TO_TRANSFER_OUTPUT.  When NEVER, no output files are transferred back ever.  Useful if the job is a wrapper that handles input and output itself.  For example, a job might pull a workload from a database or web service and write results back there.  Any files created might be temporary. You can put them in a subdirectory, but that adds needless complication.  If also returns standard output and error, which may also be unwanted.  Ian specifically notes that he wants standard output and error on the execute note for debugging, but no to be returned, so setting them to NULL won't work.\n\n</p><p>Note: If you want standard output and error, but not any other files, you can do so with  +TransferOutput=\"\" . It should work with transfer_output_files=, but doesn't (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2311\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2311'); return false;\" title='allow transfer_output_files=  to mean \"nothing\"'>#2311</a></span>)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Jul-27 10:38:20 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nCondor_submit now supports the following:\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>transfer_output_files = \"\"\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This disables all output transfer other than stdout and stderr, whose transfer can already be disabled via other attributes.\nSee ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5159\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5159'); return false;\" title=\"condor_submit should allow an empty file transfer list.\">#5159</a></span>.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Jul-27 10:38", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2011-Jul-18 14:58", "fixed_version": "2011-Jul-18 14:58", "broken_version": "v060000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
