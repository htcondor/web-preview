Comments indicate it does a random secondary\nsort of names, but it looks like it doesn't really. The sort needs to be\nchanged to either\n\n1) based on starvation\n\n2) based on prio and then a true secondary sort on starvation.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I think option (2) is reasonable, since the primary sort on submitter priority is a longstanding behavior.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jun-15 12:30:58 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nThe analog of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2186\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2186'); return false;\" title=\"groups are not sorted in starvation order\">#2186</a></span> here would be sorting by (submitter_usage/submitter_limit).  Currently, the sorting of submitters occurs before submitter limits are computed.  Also, those limits are currently computed on the fly, not attached to the submitter structure.\n\n<p>To do the above, there would have to be a new loop assigning submitter limits (perhaps just the submitter limit of spin-1 could be used for convenience) to the submitter ads, prior to the sort.\n\n</p><p>Another lower-impact option might be to sort by some surrogate like submitter_usage / (idle+running).  That does not take into account the negotiator's view of the submitter's limit or group quota, but it is a reasonable measure of starvation and could be accomplished without moving the logic for submitter limit computations around.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-24 11:23:34 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nrepro/test\n\n<p>Using the following configuration, which sets a very large PRIORITY_HALFLIFE so that user priorities all remain equal at 0.5:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">CLAIM_WORKLIFE = 0\nNEGOTIATOR_CONSIDER_PREEMPTION = FALSE\nNEGOTIATOR_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG\n\nNEGOTIATOR_USE_SLOT_WEIGHTS = FALSE\n\nGROUP_QUOTA_MAX_ALLOCATION_ROUNDS = 1\n\nNEGOTIATOR_INTERVAL = 30\nSCHEDD_INTERVAL = 15\n\nPRIORITY_HALFLIFE = 1e100\n\nNUM_CPUS = 20\n\nGROUP_NAMES = a\nGROUP_QUOTA_a = 20\n\nGROUP_ACCEPT_SURPLUS = FALSE\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The following three job submissions are used in a sequence (submission 2 will be used twice).
