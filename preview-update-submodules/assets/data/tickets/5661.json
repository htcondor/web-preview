While this make sense, it seems like it should also be mentioned in a list of advertised metrics and/or the list of grid resource ad attributes.\n\n</p><p>Additionally, while we have a section in Appendix A for (some of the) <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DaemonCore\" title=\"Daemon Core\">DaemonCore</a></span> statistics, we don't appear to have a section for any other possibly-shared attributes, and the section is question doesn't actually contain any information.\n\n</p><p>Jaime will also be adding some grid manager statistics about how it more-generally interacts with its GAHPs, so both of these question may soon become more relevant.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2016-May-05 15:22", "status": "new", "created": "2016-May-05 15:22", "fixed_version": "2016-May-05 15:22", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
