In many instances they may have done it to themselves. This means one could look at the jobs waiting and similar jobs running to perhaps find jobs which could be redesigned. Things like placing files such that execute node fetches could occur.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Feb-20 13:22:22 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is part of the ongoing work in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3487\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3487'); return false;\" title=\"implement fair sharing in transfer queue\">#3487</a></span> and <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3333\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3333'); return false;\" title=\"improve file transfer management\">#3333</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2013-Feb-20 13:23", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Feb-19 17:01", "fixed_version": "2013-Feb-19 17:01", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
