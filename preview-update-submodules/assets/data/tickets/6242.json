{"id": 6242, "title": "Ticket #6242: Debian jessie upstream package named htcondor", "description": "<blockquote>\nDebian has renamed its OS-provided package to htcondor. This means that adding the UW-managed repo and running \"apt-get install condor\" runs into conflicts and that \"apt-get upgrade\" doesn't see a reason to upgrade the package.\n\n<p>One solution is for the UW-managed package to set \"Provides: htcondor\" in its package settings. Alternative you could rename your package and set \"Provides: condor\" for backwards compatibility. Either option allows \"apt-get install condor\" to behave as it currently does.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2018-Oct-04 15:31", "status": "resolved", "created": "2017-Apr-29 14:07", "fixed_version": "2017-Apr-29 14:07", "broken_version": "v080600", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tpdownes", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
