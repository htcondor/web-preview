I have not dug into the code, but I suspect that this happened because fetch-work caused the slot's <code>ClaimId</code> to be changed, thus creating a race condition between fetch-work and the negotiation cycle.\n\n</p><p>This problem was particularly bad because of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2170\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2170'); return false;\" title=\"assertion fails in dedicated scheduler when claim request is rejected\">#2170</a></span>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Jan-13 15:20:01 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nIIRC, this is by design, and maybe not optimal. The fetch-work (pull) and negotiation-cycle (push) work are on the same footing. The push'd work should not trump the pull'd. That's up to the RANK policy. Possibly preemption policy should be taken into account in these situations.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Feb-10 14:43:26 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nTodd claims that this is only an issue when fetch-work jobs run for less than ~1 minute before exiting.\n\n<p>If that's true, then this is a lower-priority issue (but still an issue).  If that's <em>not</em> true, then this is important.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2015-Sep-21 11:28", "status": "defer", "created": "2011-May-20 17:10", "fixed_version": "2011-May-20 17:10", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "a22161", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
