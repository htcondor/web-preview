Today, I observed BNL removing 28000 jobs at once (cleanup from <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=528\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('528'); return false;\" title=\"BNL schedd periodic expression eval excessively infrequent\">#528</a></span>). The procedure took 28 minutes to complete, during which time the schedd didn't do anything else. Its ad aged out of the collector and all connections to it went unanswered.\n\n<p>BNL has observed the same behavior occurring when the schedd evaluates the periodic policy expressions on all the jobs in the queue. The schedd was unresponsive for over 6 minutes while evaluating the periodic expressions.\n\n</p><p>It would be nice if the schedd could remain responsive during these long actions.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 05:58", "status": "new", "created": "2009-May-27 16:22", "fixed_version": "2009-May-27 16:22", "broken_version": "v070300", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "atlas", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
