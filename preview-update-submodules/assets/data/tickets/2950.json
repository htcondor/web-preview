{"id": 2950, "title": "Ticket #2950: Have a condor_submit mechanism for dealing with random seeds", "description": "<blockquote>\nMiron suggested this in today's BMRB software meeting, when we were talking about CS-Rosetta...\n\n<p>Anyhow, he wants some kind of provision in condor_submit to get a random seed and stuff it into the classad for a job (rather than having the job itself look at /dev/random at startup or something like this).  The intent of this is that, for example, if a vanilla universe got preempted and restarted, it would restart with the same random seed that it ran with the first time -- so that you'd truly be re-doing the same calculation as opposed to a different calculation.  This would also serve as a record of the random seed used, that could be helpful for debugging.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Apr-20 14:01", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Apr-20 14:01", "fixed_version": "2012-Apr-20 14:01", "broken_version": "v070705", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu,miron@cs.wisc.edu.tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
