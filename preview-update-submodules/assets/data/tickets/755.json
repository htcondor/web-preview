{"id": 755, "title": "Ticket #755: Add user log file rotation option", "description": "<blockquote>\n(Based on a report by Scot Kronenfeld for the VDT.)\n\n<p>My Condor cron job runs every 5 minutes.  It has a user log file that is growing at ~1MB/week.  That's obviously not going to cause imminent problems, but since I intend to run this job indefinitely, I'll have to pay attention and delete that file at some point.  Also, if I were running many jobs at that rate, it could cause problems.\n\n</p><p>Proposal: allow the submit file to request some sort of user log rotation and deletion.\n\n</p><p>If <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=754\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('754'); return false;\" title=\"Option for jobs that run multiple times to append to output and error\">#754</a></span> is implemented, it may be useful to allow the output and error files to be rotated and deleted similarly.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 06:07", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Sep-22 11:47", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-22 11:47", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
