On one hand, it is nice to be able to create tickets that one is not necessarily interested in.  The \"Create a New Ticket\" page should have a message indicating that the creator of a ticket needs to be on the Notify list if she wants to receive notification and is not also the \"assigned to\" person for the ticket.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Jan-03 10:14:23 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nmatt points out that configuration can be changed at <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/setup_chng\">change setup</a>.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jan-03 10:14:50 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nI applied my suggested change.
