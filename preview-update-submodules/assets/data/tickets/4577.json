{"id": 4577, "title": "Ticket #4577: cleaning of execute directory should ignore lost+found", "description": "<blockquote>\nSuggestion from rust user:\n\n<p>I have the scratch space mounted as its own partition, and as such has a\nlost+found directory in it. It appears that the daemons remove this\ndirectory when cleaning up the scratch space. Could the lost+found be\nexempted from removal? Obviously in scratch space it's not an important\nconsideration since recovered files would be deleted anyway, but the fsck\nat boot keeps complaining that it's not there. Consider it a feature\nrequest, perhaps.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jul-16 11:57:06 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nCODE_REVIEW: code looks good.
