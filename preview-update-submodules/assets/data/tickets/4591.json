It's unclear why these files are being produced and how they're ending up outside of the spool directory when they are.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Sep-16 11:23:46 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nInitial suspicion was that the Windows machines were suspending the jobs when they entered Owner state and that this was causing the production of .vmem files (ignoring how they ended up in the wrong place).  This idea appears to have been experimentally invalidated (or more than one thing is going on).</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2014-Sep-16 11:23", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Sep-16 11:22", "fixed_version": "2014-Sep-16 11:22", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "VM", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, nyehle@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
