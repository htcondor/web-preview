Looking at the wording of that section, I can see why it might be kind of confusing...\n\n</p><p>Note that a bunch of the examples above have splices that have VARS, but Lauren thought that examples of what works and what doesn't, in the relevant section, would be useful.\n\n</p><p>I think part of the problem is that there are a couple of things that are getting combined:\n</p><ul>\n<li>You cannot have VARS or RETRY on a splice itself.\n</li><li>What happens if you try to specify VARS or RETRY, from outside the splice, on a node within a splice.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>(Also note that some of this may be affected by the \"all_nodes\" implementation -- see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5729\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5729'); return false;\" title='Allow \"for all\" for node name for script, retry, etc.'>#5729</a></span>.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2016-Sep-22 12:50</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/c72a5607ff45f55939888201387cbdada2bb6ee8\">[49263]</a></span>: Gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5890\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5890'); return false;\" title=\"Clarify manual regarding VARS within splices\">#5890</a></span>: Clarified the wording in the manual about VARS applied to nodes within splices; also clarified a bunch of other stuff in the DAGMan section, mostly related to sub-DAGs and splices.
