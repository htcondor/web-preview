{"id": 7350, "title": "Ticket #7350: Allow different slots in same startd to have different BASE_CGROUPS", "description": "<blockquote>\nLIGO would like to designate some slots in their startd to have very high relative CPU shares, and others lower.  They may also like to set other properties of the cgroup that condor currently doesn't manage, like the io priority.  To do this, we'd like to be able to set the BASE_CGROUP knob differently per SLOT_TYPE.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nDup of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7390\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7390'); return false;\" title=\"Allow 1 startd to have starters in different BASE_CGROUPs\">#7390</a></span>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:46:37 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080906 to v080907 using ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Apr-13 09:29", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2019-Oct-29 17:14", "fixed_version": "2019-Oct-29 17:14", "broken_version": "v080800", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "#7233", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
