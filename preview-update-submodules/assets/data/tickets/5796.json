{"id": 5796, "title": "Ticket #5796: python.d directory for custom classad functions", "description": "<blockquote>\nI have created several custom functions for use with SUBMIT_REQUIREMENTS. Presently, I have made these available to Condor by placing them in a system location such as /usr/lib/python2.7. Obviously I could build a package to do this.\n\n<p>Or, I could ask you to develop a feature. The idea is to have an /etc/condor/python.d directory that is \"useful\" in some way for developing custom classad functions. It could be a directory that is simply appended to PYTHONPATH or, perhaps, it could be automatically scanned for functions, particularly those that \"register.\"\n\n</p><p>Basically, I'd rather manage this under /etc/condor than in a system location since the functions have no use in any other context.\n\n</p><p>Tom</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2016-Jul-21 11:50", "status": "defer", "created": "2016-Jul-21 11:50", "fixed_version": "2016-Jul-21 11:50", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tpdownes", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
