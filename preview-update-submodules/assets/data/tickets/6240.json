Part of this change was setting the attributes based on the job proxy that's received when the job's input sandbox is spooled to the schedd over the network. The code to modify the job ad in the queue is run in a child process of the schedd, which is a big No-No. The changes won't appear in the schedd's in-memory copy of the job queue. Worse, they can corrupt the on-disk job_queue.log file, due to competing writes from the two processes.\n\n<p>Ben Jones at CERN has reported multiple occurrences of this when attempting to upgrade from 8.5.5 to 8.6 or 8.7.\n\n</p><p>It should be easy to move the problematic code into the main schedd process, in the reaper for the child process doing the file transfer.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-May-05 12:18:44 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nTo prevent this in the future, we should poison <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> log write methods in forked child processes.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-May-08 11:43:56 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE_REVIEW</strong>: change looks good.
