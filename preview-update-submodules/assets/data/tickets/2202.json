{"id": 2202, "title": "Ticket #2202: Failure during stage-in not handled properly for cream jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf the gridmanager restarts during stage-in of a cream job, the gridmanager assumes stage-in has finished and tells cream to submit the job to the back-end scheduler. This will lead to failures due to missing or incomplete input files, which may not be detected at the CREAM/Condor layer.\n\n<p>The gridmanager needs to record something in the job ad when stage-in is complete so that it knows when it needs to retry it during recovery. Ideally, it would detect which file to resume from.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 14:37:38 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed a fix to V7_6-branch for 7.6.2.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Jun-02 13:51</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/2ac7fb72caaf5e37f93466caf4c5644e11c15fae\">[22088]</a></span>: Fix recovery of cream jobs during stage-in. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2202\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2202'); return false;\" title=\"Failure during stage-in not handled properly for cream jobs\">#2202</a></span> Add cast to fix Windows build.
