We've just\nupgraded to 7.2.4 (the same issue occurred in our brief use of 7.2.3) from\n6.8.8, and have noticed that the notify_user feature in the submit file has\nstopped working on the Windows XP machines.  Strangely enough, it still\nworks just fine on our lone Windows 2000 machine.\n\n</p><p>The error we get from our mail server is:\n\n</p><p> \"Wed 2009-06-24 08:37:18: *  Winsock Error 10054 Connection was reset by\nthe other side!\"\nDoes anyone have any idea what might be happening?  There have been no\nchanges to the pool computers (or submit files) other than the Condor\nversion change.\n\n</p><p>Thanks much in advance...</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2013-Jan-28 15:27", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jun-28 19:34", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-28 19:34", "broken_version": "v070204", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "burnett", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
