Example use case: glideinWMS would like to use the collector for aggregating glidein error reports, and having these logged would be helpful.\n\n<p>This feature could be implemented as a collector plugin.  However, depending on the state of the classad history code used by the schedd and startd, it may be easiest to support this feature directly in the collector.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Sep-08 11:01", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Sep-08 11:01", "fixed_version": "2011-Sep-08 11:01", "broken_version": "v070700", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "isfiligoi@ucsd.edu,dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
