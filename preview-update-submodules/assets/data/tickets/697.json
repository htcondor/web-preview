{"id": 697, "title": "Ticket #697: condor_pool absent list tool should use condorstatus exclude list", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe CSL believes they should maintain the canonical list of where Condor is welcome to run (CSL #377232, adesmet).  They export a list of machines marked Y or N for condor as /common/usr/share/Info/condorstatus AKA /afs/cs.wisc.edu/s/lab-1/common/lib/volatile/condorstatus.  The condor_pool absent list tool should use this file as the canonical source of machines; if a machine is marked as \"N\" and isn't running Condor, it should not appear as absent.  If a machine is marked as \"N\" and is running Condor, we might want to report that, but that seems lower priority.\n\n<p>(There are some reconciliation problems in making the CSL the canonical source, that's being addressed in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=449\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('449'); return false;\" title=\"Resolve discrepencies between CSL and condor views of pool\">#449</a></span>.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Aug-26 16:07:54 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is certainly very different from the way that the tool has always operated...</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2009-Dec-17 14:01", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Aug-26 15:56", "fixed_version": "2009-Aug-26 15:56", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "nleroy", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
