{"id": 7526, "title": "Ticket #7526: Shadow wrongly does not recogize or log JOB_NOT_STARTED.", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn <code>BaseShadow::logEvictEvent()</code>, we check for <code>JOB_CKPTED</code>, <code>JOB_NOT_CKPTED</code>, and <code>JOB_KILLED</code>; if the evict reason isn't one of those, we don't log it, claiming the reason is unknown.  This log message -- and absence of a log entry -- can regularly occur if the schedd starts a job's shadow before the previous occupant of that slot has finished evicting, because the eviction reason in that case is JOB_NOT_STARTED.\n\n<p>Until we rearchitect the startd, this race condition is unavoidable; but since we explicitly check for it, we probably should print a scary message to the log <em>and</em> not tell the user what happened.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Feb-26 13:40", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Feb-26 13:40", "fixed_version": "2020-Feb-26 13:40", "broken_version": "v080805", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
