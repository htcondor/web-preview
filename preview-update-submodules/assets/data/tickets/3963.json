Iterative changes in the build and test lab were time consuming and thus this test allowed local workspace testing to generate the no core and error file handling.\n\n<p>The test runs a simple job from the Check folder followed by a log search\nfor the daemon's chosen(currently negotiator) PID from it's log file(Using Check\nlog searching tools. When the on_match callback occurs, we extract to PID and send\nkill -SIGSEGV.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Oct-03 10:55", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Oct-03 10:55", "fixed_version": "2013-Oct-03 10:55", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "bt", "derived_from": "#3594", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
