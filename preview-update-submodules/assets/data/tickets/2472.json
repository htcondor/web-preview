Calling code would get integer values as 'int' or 'long' or 'long long', etc.  In practice, this ideal is violated in various places.\n</li><li>The <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=IntType\" title=\"Int Type\">IntType</a></span> data type is also defined in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> class definition, so that customer code using the classad libs can refer to \"ClassAd::IntType\" as a convenient synonym for \"classad::IntType\"\n</li><li>classad API functions that currently return 'int&amp;' on the parameter list, e.g. ClassAd::EvaluateAttrInt(), now support an additional 'long long' overloading.\n</li><li>the same is true for int-returning functions at the compat_classad layer, e.g. Assign(... long long&amp;), LookupInteger(... long long&amp;) and EvalInteger(long long&amp;).\n</li><li>param_integer() from the config library has new friends param_long() and param_long_long()\n</li><li>If calling code asks for 'int&amp;' from a classad, and the evaluated value exceeds min/max 'int' value, the current proposed semantic is to return error condition if the function does this, or EXCEPT if no error return code is possible.   Other proposed semantics were to cap the values at min/max value for return type.\n</li><li>The new functionality is currently unit tested in OTEST_Old_Classad.cpp and the new FTEST_config.cpp\n</li><li>There are cases in the condor code where the interface layer with compat_classad and/or classad is bypassed - that is, where a direct reference to <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=IntType\" title=\"Int Type\">IntType</a></span> is required, even though that type was ideally going to be internal.  I changed required declarations to <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=IntType\" title=\"Int Type\">IntType</a></span> in those places.   Ideally, those places are candidates for rewriting in the future to adhere to classad or compat_classad functions instead, but I considered that out of the scope for this ticket.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Some of my working assumptions regarding mixed pools: there are two likely cases (imo): the case where a 64-bit value is configured in config file, in which case I expect such values to be mostly used locally to machines.  If you configure 64 bit values, and the code can handle 64 bit values, and the environment supports them, then this will work.   Otherwise it will fail, however that is already true, so I don't see this as loss of functionality.\n\n</p><p>The other case is values residing on various classads.   Here, the main potential problem I see is that somehow a value on a 64-bit machine grows to &gt; 2 gig, and then goes over the wire to a 32 bit machine, where it is likely to cause problems.  I don't see any way for this to not cause problems, however I also see these as likely to be rare, since pools today appear to be running fine and not generating such large values.  If they were, we'd already be seeing bad behavior.\n\n</p><p>What our overflow policy is will need to be considered.  the proposed policy is described above, however perhaps an \"all EXCEPT\" policy is even better to avoid any code that ignores return values, and fail early and informatively.\n\n</p><p>I think that mixed pool related problems are best dealt with via educating the user community via any needed documentation and other support.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jan-24 11:15:29 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nMatt recommended auditing for classad attributes and config params that are most at-risk for causing overflow problems in a mixed pool.\n\n<p>Running list:\n</p><ul>\n<li>attributes or params related to filesystem sizes, file sizes\n</li><li>attributes related to RAM/mem\n</li><li>schedd cumulative statistics</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2012\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2012'); return false;\" title=\"support 64-bit integer literals and values in the ClassAd language\">#2012</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nsupport 64-bit integer literals and values in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> language</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3248\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3248'); return false;\" title=\"Expose 64-bit integers and doubles in ClassAd compatibility layer\">#3248</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nExpose 64-bit integers and doubles in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> compatibility layer</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/525/gt2472-classad-64-bit-int.patch\">gt2472-classad-64-bit-int.patch</a>\n112778 bytes added by eje on 2012-Jan-20 16:54:53 UTC.\n<br/>\nIncreases the supported integer value precision of classad expressions to 64 bits.<br/>\n</li><li><a href=\"../files/526/gt2472_stdu.patch\">gt2472_stdu.patch</a>\n2725 bytes added by jfrey on 2012-Jan-20 23:34:20 UTC.\n<br/>\nFix for standard universe with new classad 64-bit changes.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Jun-27 10:53</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/798418ea63421a033bd15fb80c11f0af7b900882\">[32493]</a></span>: Fix 64-bit classad calls to work with caching changes. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2472\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2472'); return false;\" title=\"Increase precision of classad::Value::integerValue to 64 bits\">#2472</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Apr-16 15:23</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/ca952ad5bdded0a051ee22e547163724aa72e291\">[32491]</a></span>: First pass to increase classad integers to 64 bits. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2472\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2472'); return false;\" title=\"Increase precision of classad::Value::integerValue to 64 bits\">#2472</a></span> Classad integers are now internally reprsented as type long long.
