{"id": 2702, "title": "Ticket #2702: Document DAGMan file descriptor issues", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe should document the issues DAGMan currently has with the number of file descriptors that it may need (depending on the structure of the DAG, etc.).\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a very wide DAG, and each node job has a separate log file, this will cause DAGMan to have many file descriptors open at once (e.g., 10,000 or more if your DAG is wide enough).\n</li><li>I think the default limit for file descriptors for a process on Linux is 10k, but the limit on Windows is currently 512.  Z is planning to raise this to 2048 (the most we can have using the C runtime).\n</li><li>A workaround is to have the node jobs share the same log file (an easy way is by not specifying a log file at all in your submit files -- DAGMan will supply a default).</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Dec-12 14:51:06 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nRaised to 2048.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Dec-12 14:51:31 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nUh, raised to 2048 in 7.6 branch and merged through 7.7.3 and 7.7.4 and master.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jul-25 13:41:55 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nClarifications went into V7_8-branch, ostensibly for 7.8.2.
