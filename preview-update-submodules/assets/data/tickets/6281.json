{"id": 6281, "title": "Ticket #6281: Starter should set a new attribute rather than JobStartDate", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently (8.7.1 and earlier) the Starter sets <code>JobStartDate</code> to the time that it called create_process to begin the job's executable.  This is a bug, since <code>JobStartDate</code> is defined to be the start time of the <strong>first</strong> execution of the job, and is set correctly by the Schedd.  This bug has been partially fixed by <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6280\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6280'); return false;\" title=\"starter incorrectly sets JobStartDate to the current job start time\">#6280</a></span>, but that only solved the problem for the Schedd and the job queue.  The Startd currently sees the wrong value for <code>JobStartDate</code>.\n\n<p>We should define a new attribute for the Starter to set, so that policy expressions in the Startd can use that instead of <code>JobStartDate</code>. Perhaps <code>ExecutionStartTime</code> ?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 10:50", "status": "new", "created": "2017-May-23 14:00", "fixed_version": "2017-May-23 14:00", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#6280", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "s8695", "customer_group": "support", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
