{"id": 6700, "title": "Ticket #6700: min & max job run times as explicit timers (ints)", "description": "<blockquote>\nMiron gave us what sounded to me like pretty explicit instructions during our discussion (regarding <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6664\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6664'); return false;\" title=\"condor_drain -start ... broken?\">#6664</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6697\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6697'); return false;\" title=\"coordinated retirement while draining breaks HOLD_IF_MEMORY_EXCEEDED\">#6697</a></span>, and the issues discovered during the testing thereof) on Friday: add minimum and maximum job run times as simple (integer) first-class /matchable/ constants.  The assumption appears to have been that these knobs will be exclusive of PREEMPT in practice (although this may be because we're assuming that a new, non-PREEMPT knob will be used to deal with the misbehaving jobs for which max job retirement time should be ignored).\n\n<p>I'm opening this ticket so we don't forget about this; it doesn't seem directly related to the issue of adding a sematic for ignoring max job retirement time (although it may depend on it, see parenthetical remark above).\n\n</p><p>Implementing this ticket should also obviate the need to rename MAXJOBRETIREMENTTIME (and <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=MaxJobRetirementTime\" title=\"Max Job Retirement Time\">MaxJobRetirementTime</a></span>), because everyone should stop using it (them).\n\n</p><p>We would also like to have users be able to specify required minimum and expected maximum durations in their jobs, and have those automatically be included in the requirements expression, like the request_* attributes.\n\n</p><p>We should think hard about the actual names for everything mentioned here.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2018-Jun-15 16:38", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Jun-11 16:48", "fixed_version": "2018-Jun-11 16:48", "broken_version": "v080708", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, gthain@wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
