{"id": 5244, "title": "Ticket #5244: Improve security UX", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe default security settings should be improved to make it easier for our administrators to use higher-security methods.  In particular, if we changed the (param table) default for the HTCondor map file to a particular value, we could create a file for the corresponding location (and use the packaging to install it) which does what the hard-coded defaults do (if there's no map file at all).  After adding support for comments in the map file, we could then explain the options there.  This seems like a best practice.\n\n<p>Additionally, if we preserve the GSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP (?) default for GSI in the HTCondor map file, we could (more?) easily add a metaknob 'use security : gsi' for administrators which already have GSI configured.\n\n</p><p>A detail for Zach to consider is what to do if an entry in the map file is missing.  Presently, security rejects, but this allows abuse of the mapfile as a whitelist, and changing those semantics would be Bad(TM).  Perhaps we could map to unmapped@method instead, and add 'unmapped@*' to the default DENY list(s), instead?\n\n</p><p>[This may have been prompted by Brian Lin.]</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Nov-16 10:06", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Aug-28 11:07", "fixed_version": "2015-Aug-28 11:07", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
