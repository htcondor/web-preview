As multi-core machines become more commmon, it becomes increasinly likely that a given machine will always have at least 1 slot in the CLAIMED or PREEMPTING state.  This essentially disables condor_preen, since if it detects a slot in one of those states, it will assume that all execute subdirectories are in use and will not clean up any of them.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Jan-26 10:00:16 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nWell... preen should only have to cleanup for jobs that failed to cleanup for whatever reason.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Jan-26 10:00", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jan-26 09:54", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-26 09:54", "broken_version": "v070705", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "s8109", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
