{"id": 5134, "title": "Ticket #5134: Identity and AddressV1", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs exemplified by <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5128\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5128'); return false;\" title=\"Collector tries to authenticate with self\">#5128</a></span>, we don't generally have a good grasp of daemon identity, or at least what it means to compare addresses to determine if they're the same.\n\n<p>We should leverage AddressV1 to answer this question more readily / comprehensively / correctly.  We may be most-interested in asking if a given address points to the current daemon, rather than if two addresses \"intersect\" (that is, if at least one route from each address refers to the same process).\n\n</p><p>This may only be an issue with config-file addresses?  We may claim it's OK to require that command-line addresses (as opposed to hostnames, possibly with port numbers) be complete source routes, instead of trying to look those up in the collector.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jul-31 10:10:13 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nSee also <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5185\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5185'); return false;\" title=\"Collector still tries to authenticate itself.\">#5185</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Aug-24 14:17", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jul-06 14:30", "fixed_version": "2015-Jul-06 14:30", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
