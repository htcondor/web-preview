New arguments should be added to these tools to bring them up to date.\n\n<p>Even worse, the command line parsing is quite primitive, resulting in unexpected behavior, for instance until 8.1.6 <code>condor_off -defrag</code> would parse as <code>condor_off -debug</code> which would turn off all of the daemons except the master.  The command line parsing should be brought up to date.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-May-13 11:09", "status": "new", "created": "2014-May-08 14:40", "fixed_version": "2014-May-08 14:40", "broken_version": "v080100", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#3717", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
