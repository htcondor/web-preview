Would this configuration setting linger in its behavior even if it were condor_reconfig'd to <code>False</code>?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Oct-12 11:50:26 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\n<div class=\"strike\">\n<strike>Because the job is essentially immediately entering the Retiring state, I suspect a race condition between job start and =EnteredCurrentActivity=.</strike></div>\n\n\n<p>Woops!

Since Always_Run_Jobs sets MAXJOBRETIREMENTTIME to MAX_SIGNED_INT (or thereabouts), Limit_Job_Runtime doesn't actually limit job run time.\n\n<p>Do we also need to add the Retiring state to the PREEMPT expression?</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2016-Oct-12 13:35", "status": "defer", "created": "2016-Oct-11 10:16", "fixed_version": "2016-Oct-11 10:16", "broken_version": "v080507", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tpdownes", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
