That is not the problem.  I like that\nfeature.  The problem is that condor treated the job like it had\nsucceeded.  This was particularly problematic because the job was part\nof a much larger DAG job.   Dagman assumed the job completed\nsuccessfully and submitted all of its children.  The children in turn\nfailed because they depend on the output file of the parent job as an\ninput file.\n\n</p><p>I can see how someone might want it both ways (fail or not based on a\nfailed file transfer).  Would it be possible to add a flag to the submit\nfile stating that if the file transfer fails the job should be treated\nas incomplete and run again?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2014-May-29 15:45", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Apr-08 15:34", "fixed_version": "2014-Apr-08 15:34", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "a26801", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
