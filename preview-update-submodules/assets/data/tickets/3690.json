{"id": 3690, "title": "Ticket #3690: Remove hard-coded policies on how schedd can reuse claims", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, the Claim that is given out by the Negotiator to the Schedd is very open ended. As long as it matches the Startd requirements, the only additional restrictions on the Claim are hard-coded : it cannot be used for a different user, and it must be used for a job with the same set of concurrency limits.\n\n<p>This situation has shown to be a problem when implementing the \u201cGlobal Priority\u201d feature. While the Negotiator will pick the globally higher priority job for a user, all bets are off once that job finishes, since the Schedd will pick the next job using local criteria. Other policies based on the global state of the system would equally be impossible to implement.\n\n</p><p>The proposal is thus to remove the hard-coded claim reuse logic and for the negotiator to explicitly embed the restrictions on jobs that can reuse the claim in the requirements that are sent back to the Schedd.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jul-09 17:47:08 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nAbandoning since this is a dup of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"active\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3691\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3691'); return false;\" title=\"Remove hard-coded policies on how schedd can reuse claims\">#3691</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jul-09 17:47", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2013-Jun-10 14:57", "fixed_version": "2013-Jun-10 14:57", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "sfiligoi@fnal.gov,dan@hep.wisc.edu,tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
