The path to the instance lock is hard-coded to be in /tmp.  This is not friendly to windows and is problematic in the nightly tests.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Apr-09 12:21</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/ad36a025d9edac3a188f71913e0bc45a521883e9\">[25413]</a></span>: Documented addition of JOB_ROUTER_LOCK. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1303\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1303'); return false;\" title=\"JobRouter hard-codes path to instance lock as /tmp\">#1303</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Mar-29 10:07</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/e985270c2527c01cd31fa22935c1ac2b4309816d\">[17722]</a></span>: JobRouter's instance lock is now located in LOCK by default. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1303\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1303'); return false;\" title=\"JobRouter hard-codes path to instance lock as /tmp\">#1303</a></span> Previously, it was located in /tmp and there was no config override.
