{"id": 1831, "title": "Ticket #1831: Take advantage of cgroups-based capabilities on new Linux platforms", "description": "<blockquote>\nTo finish the integration of this work, these milestone need to happen:\n<ul>\n<li>Read up and understand CGroups.\n</li><li>Add the libcgroup external.\n</li><li>Successfully apply and test the patch.\n</li><li>Ensure the discovery of the cgroup feature works on all of our platforms.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>This work had been done and is committed.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\nI would like to explore the integration of cgroups and Condor.  For those unfamiliar with cgroups, I think some of the best comprehensive background documentation is provided by Redhat:\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/index.html\">http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/index.html</a>\n\n<p>In short, cgroups are a kernel-level construct which provides the functionality of the condor_procd.  I have two short-term goals:\n</p><ol>\n<li>Improved accuracy for process accounting for memory and CPU usage.\n</li><li>Improved accuracy for job killing.\nBoth can be done to be basically 100% accurate - the current procd methodology is heuristic-based, and can be error prone.  Current best-practice is dedicated accounts or GID tracking, but neither are as transparent as cgroups.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>After examining the procd and starter code, I think these are also doable, short-term goals.  I'd like to do this without replacing the procd or even disabling the current functionality (ideally, should be kept as a fallback if cgroups fail).  My current thinking is to use  libcgroups to assist in the cgroup creation and manipulation (adding a new dependency for cmake).  The starter (some combination of VanillaProc::StartJob and OsProc::StartJob) would be responsible for creating the cgroup and launching the parent process.  The procd would register the new process family as before, but get a new command for enabling tracking based upon a cgroup's name.  The process family will become associated with the most-specific cgroup of the root PID.  There will be a CGroupTracker somewhat equivalent to the current <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GroupTracker\" title=\"Group Tracker\">GroupTracker</a></span>\n\n</p><p>When the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ProcFamily\" title=\"Proc Family\">ProcFamily</a></span> is associated with a cgroup, the aggregate_usage functions and spree functions will be replaced by their cgroups equivalent (falling back to the current implementations if the cgroups-enabled one failed).  So, most of the control flow for process startup, monitoring, and shutdown will remain the same; this seems especially important as there's quite a bit of functionality in the procd.\n\n</p><p>On the outset, the most daunting part of the implementation is a new external for libcgroups.  I think the procd and starter code changes are otherwise relatively benign.\n\n</p><p>If we can start with these changes, there are some more imaginative cgroup-related goals:\n</p><ol>\n<li>cpuset'ing.  Limit the group of processes to a specific CPU.\n</li><li>Managing I/O bandwidth for the condor execute directory device.  Prevents a process from affecting others by hitting the disk hard.\n</li><li>Private namespaces.  Provide a private PID and/or filesystem namespace.  Jobs running under the same unix account wouldn't be able to kill each other's processes or write into each other's execute directory.  Would also allow a per-job /tmp.  Somewhat deep voodoo, but would allow sites like Purdue to run all jobs as unix user nobody without worrying about the security implications.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>Thoughts?  I'd characterize the approach as:\n</p><ol>\n<li>Use libcgroups instead of manipulating the filesystem.\n</li><li>Start with a small modification to the procd.\n</li><li>Contain the worst-case scenario if the cgroup-based methods fail.</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jan-07 13:05:49 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nThanks Brain, this will be great!\n\n<p>Added Pete (psilord) to the list of folks getting email re changes to this ticket. Pete is the resident procd expert, I want him to chime in on the proposed approach.\n\n</p><p>Upon reading the above, one concern I had is part mentioning changes to the starter VanillaProc::StartJob and OsProc::StartJob methods.  In theory, the <em>only</em> changes should be to classes procapi, maybe also the procd, maybe also killfamily. The starter should not care about the mechanism by which a tree of process is being tracked (be it via group ids, cookie strings in the environment, cgroups, process table snapshots, windows jobobjects, whoatever). Also note that Condor relies on tracking groups of processes in many places, not just the starter - for example the master tracks all processes beneath it, the schedd tracks trees representing scheduler/local universe jobs.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-07 13:58:28 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nSo, I am to the point where I have enough of a patch put together that Pete can see my approach.  Currently, I'm only exposing this through the condor_procd/procd_ctl interface.  Basically, the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ProcFamilyMonitor\" title=\"Proc Family Monitor\">ProcFamilyMonitor</a></span> has been taught how to associate a given <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ProcFamily\" title=\"Proc Family\">ProcFamily</a></span> with a cgroup, and I extended this new command to proc_family_io.cpp.\n\n<p>Todd: I would prefer to keep the starter somewhat involved - it at least must explicitly asked for cgroups (mimics how tracking groups are done currently).  However, we can put the cgroup creation logic into the procd.  I don't think it alters the architecture too much.\n\n</p><p>Hopefully I can code drop the first cgroup-based <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ProcFamily\" title=\"Proc Family\">ProcFamily</a></span> tracking patch later today... I want to get at least a few of the statistics working first.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-09 23:19:57 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, see the attached cgroups_procd2.patch.  It should be ready for others to look at it.  It is integrated into both the condor_starter and the procd_ctl.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-25 13:32:03 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I've had a small chance to look at the work in this ticket. The approach seems reasonable.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-03 11:48:57 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Pete,\n\n<p>Anything I can do to help this ticket along?\n\n</p><p>Brian\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Mar-28 11:42:32 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Initial Code Review Feedback</strong>\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>The algorithm \"freezes\" all the pids in the family before sending a signal, apparently in order to send the signal atomically to the group.  This is good. However, the question is what to do if the cgroup call to freeze all the pids fails (which can happen if the process is in certain specific states).  One solution would be when the procd to send the SIGCONT or SIGKILL signal to the family, it then checks again to be certain all processes are stopped or killed. If not, then repeat. After repeating more than X times, propagate failure to the caller (which would then likely email the admin, etc). Note this issue is not specific to cgroups, but if the procd behaved this way, then we'd have an answer re what to do if cgroups fails to freeze all pids.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Code style issue - use curly braces around conditional clauses, even if they are only one line. We do this to help ensure merges don't have unexpected side effects.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-05 16:16:58 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI got preempted by the compressed ckpt in stduniv problem.

Pete, we'll need a child ticket for documentation and regression tests.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-May-02 10:54:35 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, today I'm going to review version 5 of the patch for this feature.

So, I checked in what Brian did strictly as attributed to him, and am doing additional patches which fix the rest of the problems.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-May-05 16:37:08 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nI have completed the work for this ticket.

This adds the external (although I've only tested with PROPER + libcgroup 0.37 RPM).\n\n<p>NOTE NOTE NOTE: libcgroup has a glibc error in versions prior to 0.37.  You will likely need to download the Fedora 15 RPM or install it yourself.  I used this build: <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=209020\">http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=209020</a> .  Obviously, you also need to be on a recent kernel (meaning Fedora 12 or higher)\n\n</p><p>This code can attach a cgroup to a process family, track its processes via cgroup, track its resource usage, and reliably kill things.  If you want to see something impressive, try using condor_procd to track a \"make -j4\" on the condor source directory.  Where the original procd only thinks there was 1s of user CPU (due to the number of lots of short lived processes), this successfully was able to calculate the true user+system CPU, about 300s combined for my desktop.\n\n</p><p>This code does <strong>not</strong> do the creation or the population of the cgroups themselves (although I've now poked inside libcgroup enough it should be easy work... save something for tomorrow!).  You have to do this by hand.\n\n</p><p>For a demo, create a cgroup named \"/condor\" for the memory, cpuacct, and freezer subsystem.  Add the a user's shell to it:\n</p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>mkdir -p /cgroups/{memory,cpuacct,freezer}\nmount -t cgroup -ocpuacct cpuacct /cgroups/cpuacct\nmount -t cgroup -omemory memory /cgroups/memory\nmount -t cgroup -ofreezer freezer /cgroups/freezer\nmkdir -p /cgroups/{memory,cpuacct,freezer}/condor\necho \"&lt;user shell pid&gt;\" &gt; /cgroups/memory/condor/tasks\necho \"&lt;user shell pid&gt;\" &gt; /cgroups/cpuacct/condor/tasks\necho \"&lt;user shell pid&gt;\" &gt; /cgroups/freezer/condor/tasks\n</pre></div>\n\nIn the user's shell, do a \"make -j4\".  Then, switch back to the root shell with the upgraded condor_procd and procd_ctl:\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>condor_procd -A /tmp/procd_pipe -L /dev/stderr -P &lt;user shell pid&gt; &amp;\nprocd_ctl -A /tmp/procd_pipe TRACK_BY_ASSOCIATED_CGROUP /condor\nprocd_ctl -A /tmp/procd_pipe GET_USAGE\nprocd_ctl -A /tmp/procd_pipe SUSPEND_FAMILY\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Viola!  Assuming you haven't just uncovered a new bug, this should perfectly track memory and CPU usage, as well as prove to be more adept at sending signals to processes (no race conditions when giving a process tree a signal!).<br/>\n</p></li><li><a href=\"attach_get/264/cgroups_procd2.patch\">cgroups_procd2.patch</a>\n54774 bytes added by bbockelm on 2011-Jan-10 05:16:25 UTC.\n<br/>\nHere's a more complete patch.
