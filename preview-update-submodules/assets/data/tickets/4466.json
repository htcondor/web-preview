{"id": 4466, "title": "Ticket #4466: Starter Suggestions", "description": "<blockquote>\nOur MATLAB bin directory is mounted on the exec nodes as a read-only\nfilesystem. When a MATLAB job dumps core, the condor_starter tries to\nrename the /cluster/MATLAB/R2008b/bin/core file to core.1234567.0 - the\nassociated cluster/process ID - under the UID of the job owner. I assume\nit's looking in the bin directory because that's where the executable or\nthe working directory is set.\n\n<p>However, the core file would never be created since that directory is\nread-only, and so the rename() attempt wasn't necessary in the first\nplace. Also, I have adjusted my core pattern so that core dumps are\ncentrally stored and managed, so there wouldn't have been a file simply\nnamed \"core\" even if the directory were writable, and some sites here\nprevent creation of core dumps entirely by setting a zero size limit in\n/etc/security/limits.d.\n\n</p><p>I've tweaked my audit rules to filter these events, but you may wish to\nhave the starter do a stat() and/or a permissions check before it assumes\nthe uid of the job submitter and tries to rename a file which may or may\nnot exist.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Jul-17 16:36", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Jul-17 14:19", "fixed_version": "2014-Jul-17 14:19", "broken_version": "v080200", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bt", "rust": "s8453", "customer_group": "support", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
