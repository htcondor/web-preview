{"id": 1762, "title": "Ticket #1762: Core limits not set correctly for DAG node jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nTodd M ran into this problem, and I've done a bit of investigating -- it seems like DAG node jobs end up with a core size limit of 0, unless CREATE_CORE_FILES is true for the schedd.  It seems like something in daemoncore sets the soft limit to 0 inside the DAGMan process.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Nov-08 21:04:48 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI've done some investigating, and what's going on is this:\nIn check_core_files() in daemon_core_main.cpp, RLIMIT_CORE gets set to zero if the param CREATE_CORE_FILES is false.  The manual says that CREATE_CORE_FILES defaults to undefined, but it actually seems to default to false.  So by the time the DAGMan process is going to run condor_submit for a node job, its own soft core limit has been set to zero unless CREATE_CORE_FILES is true.  Condor_submit then inherits the core limit from DAGMan, and sets <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CoreSize\" title=\"Core Size\">CoreSize</a></span> accordingly.\n\n<p>So the summary is that CREATE_CORE_FILES, which is supposed to apply to the Condor daemons, ends up also applying to any DAG node jobs.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Dec-03 16:54:45 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThis got fixed (and documented) a few weeks ago, but for some reason I forgot to resolve the ticket, so I'll do that now...</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Nov-11 11:22</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/694c1ffbf5b5e20a0d25b659a2769b8580272553\">[25761]</a></span>: Fixed gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1762\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1762'); return false;\" title=\"Core limits not set correctly for DAG node jobs\">#1762</a></span>: coredumpsize limit for DAGMan and its node jobs is now set according to the user's coredumpsize limit, rather than according to the CREATE_CORE_FILES config setting.
