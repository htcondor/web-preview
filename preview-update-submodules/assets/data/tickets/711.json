This would be used to test the above, as well as provide the framework for some other new tests of the log writing code, as well, including a test for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=601\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('601'); return false;\" title=\"Event log rotation on Win32 probably broken with &gt;1 writer process\">#601</a></span>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:22", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Sep-03 13:12", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-03 13:12", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "nleroy", "derived_from": "#561", "creator": "nleroy", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
