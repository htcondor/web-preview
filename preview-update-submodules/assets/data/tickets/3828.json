It may even be older than 7.0.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jul-31 16:53:40 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI have submitted a patch that fixes the low-level problem of trying in a blocking loop to connect to a host that is dead.\n\n<p>The high-level problem still needs to be fixed, because each attempt to connect to a dead host still typically takes a second or two to fail (as opposed to the minimum of one minute it took to fail prior to the low-level fix).  The problem is that each time <code>sendReschedule()</code> is called, a new query is performed to look up the address of the negotiator.  Inside <code>Daemon::getDaemonInfo()</code>, we instantiate a new <code>CollectorList</code>.  Inside there is some code to remember that a particular collector wasted a bunch of our time when we tried to connect to it.  But this knowledge is not preserved, because it is chucked out when the <code>CollectorList</code> is destructed.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-01 10:01:27 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nNote:  Commit on Aug 1 by Karen is cherry pick of 8.0.2 version history item that got committed on master branch.  Cherry pick is into V8_0-branch.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-07 20:28:23 by sfiligoi:</em> <br/>\n\nHow about the use case where the Collector is simply not running? E.g. due to the fact that it is undergoing software maintenance?\n\n<p>And what about the use case of completely lost packets? No ICMP reply?\n\n</p><p>Will the HA code switch fast to the next collector in these cases?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-08 10:01:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nThe low-level fix is indeed still vulnerable to a lengthy connection delay.  It is therefore important to have the higher-level code remember this and failover to the next collector for a while.  That does happen in some parts of condor, but not in the schedd when sending a RESCHEDULE command.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-12 17:20:00 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI created a patch for the higher-level problem.  Now the record of painfully long collector queries is kept globally in each daemon, rather than only surviving as long as the <code>CollectorList</code> object.  I have committed this to the master branch.  It could be cherry picked back into V8_0-branch if there is strong enough need for it, and it is deemed safe enough.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-20 11:30:17 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong>\n\n<p>This review is for the 8.0.2 patch only (37056), which looks good.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3946\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3946'); return false;\" title=\"Bad collector name crashes daemons and tools\">#3946</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nBad collector name crashes daemons and tools</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Aug-14 11:25</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f2bf748433228b5506322b3180a1054cf2d052b8\">[37213]</a></span>: minor 8.0.2 version history item edit ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3828\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3828'); return false;\" title=\"HA schedd frequently blocks on dead collector\">#3828</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Aug-12 17:17</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/db45cafc926f6afdd81fb5929830efb401627c13\">[37175]</a></span>: Keep global history of blacklisted collectors. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3828\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3828'); return false;\" title=\"HA schedd frequently blocks on dead collector\">#3828</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Aug-01 09:59</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/8d54f5386f7ff39fac0ec83eb6e32ee390b52508\">[37059]</a></span>: Version history. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3828\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3828'); return false;\" title=\"HA schedd frequently blocks on dead collector\">#3828</a></span> Committer: Karen Miller  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jul-31 16:42</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/afb1c3c7cea4af06e5dbdb9c9bf50a1ab3000323\">[37057]</a></span>: Version history. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3828\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3828'); return false;\" title=\"HA schedd frequently blocks on dead collector\">#3828</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jul-31 16:28</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/2db8a1cc1d819aa1d48e478ed06cbd5097d9b757\">[37056]</a></span>: Do not keep trying in the connect loop when the target host is down. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3828\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3828'); return false;\" title=\"HA schedd frequently blocks on dead collector\">#3828</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Oct-14 15:27", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Jul-30 17:27", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-30 17:27", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "a25841", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu, isfiligoi@ucsd.edu", "due_date": ""}
