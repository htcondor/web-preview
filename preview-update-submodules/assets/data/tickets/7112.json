{"id": 7112, "title": "Ticket #7112: Advertise HasSelfCheckpointTransfers in 8.8", "description": "<blockquote>\nAlthough the ability to transfer [files back to the submit node] on a [successful] self-checkpoint has existed for some time, we haven't officially supported it, so we've never advertised the ability.  It seems wise to do so, since we'll shortly be adding first-class submit file commands for them, and you certainly don't want to run a self-checkpointing job under a starter which doesn't support them.\n\n<p>We propose that subsequent feature expansion be tied to other but similar booleans that subsume the previous booleans.  For example, if we add the ability to specify checkpoint servers via plugins (e.g., <code>box://</code>), we would advertise both <code>HasSelfCheckpointTransfers</code> and <code>HasSelfCheckpointTransfersToURLs</code>, but any given job would only require one of those (because the latter includes the former).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Jun-18 15:59:20 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nDocument <code>HasSelfCheckpointTransfers</code> as a machine ad attribute.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Jul-08 16:08:43 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE_REVIEW</strong> looks good. doc can version history needed.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Jul-08 16:13</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/ab0cad56a8748c820a8a7036116b1742025ad27a\">[57347]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7112\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7112'); return false;\" title=\"Advertise HasSelfCheckpointTransfers in 8.8\">#7112</a></span>) Documentation and release note.
