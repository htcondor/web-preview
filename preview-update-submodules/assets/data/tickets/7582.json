I just wanted to throw a really general question out there, but I haven't thought about this AT ALL so maybe it doesn't make sense and we can disregard this comment.  But anyhow:\n\n<p>The problem was a mismatch of what was used for identifying session: the session was being stored under a different key than was being used to look it up (stored with private network info, lookup without).  This latest code change keeps the private network name to store them and also to look them up.  This makes the sesion ids match, and is the most specific, so this will certainly work.  Did we consider the just the opposite, which is to <strong>remove</strong> the private info for both storing and retrieving?  This might allow better session reuse and/or cut down on unnecessary information being transmitted.  On the other hand it might create a conflict by having two distinct entities trying to use the same identifier.\n\n</p><p>Like I said, I haven't thought about it and don't want to switch contexts so if someone who actually looked at it and understood can chime in please do.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Jul-02 16:29:40 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nIIRC, we didn't consider making the identifier less specific because this problem happened when we started including the whole Sinful in the identifier, which we did for some good reason which I don't presently recall.  (It may have just been that the old &lt;ip:port&gt; style wasn't enough and it seems safer to use all of the indentifier bits that we have.)</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Jul-02 14:12</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/b96bb668fbfdbab3863d8d8ff43933ad09fb9c1a\">[60066]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7582\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7582'); return false;\" title=\"SINful mangled when flocking\">#7582</a></span>) Release note.
