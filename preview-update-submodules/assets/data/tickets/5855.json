{"id": 5855, "title": "Ticket #5855: Move decision about shared port endpoint creation into daemon core.", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight now, daemon core daemons will create shared port endpoints if USE_SHARED_PORT is set, even if the master decided not to let them inherit a shared point endpoint.

This logic will be complicated by our support for running the daemons without a master.  At any rate, while it might make sense to further modify the master to also support &lt;SUBSYS&gt;_USE_SHARED_PORT (or maybe &lt;DAEMON_NAME&gt;_USE_SHARED_PORT?), it seems like we'd be better off letting the HAD and REPLICATION daemons declare as a special exception to the general rule, that they will respect [HAD|REPLICATION]_USE_SHARED_PORT instead of USE_SHARED_PORT (because their configuration changes quite a bit when they use shared port).</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-Aug-19 13:53", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Aug-19 13:53", "fixed_version": "2016-Aug-19 13:53", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5769", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
