This almost certainly means that the spot instance request was purged between our last status update and when we tried to something (whatever just failed) with it, and we should react appropriately.  (Including checking, if we can, to see if the vanished spot request started an instance while we weren't looking.)</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-Apr-11 16:26", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Apr-11 16:25", "fixed_version": "2016-Apr-11 16:25", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "fermi", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
