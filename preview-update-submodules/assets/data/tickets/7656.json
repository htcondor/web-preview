This may be memory-intensive for large responses; we strongly recommend to utilize the =xquery()=\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>The first half of this is accurate, but the opinion at the end is just wrong: most people will not be doing a large enough query to warrant the need to use <code>xquery</code>, which has performance impacts on the submit machine. Instead of this scary warning, we should just clearly and explicitly state the differences between <code>query</code> and <code>xquery</code> and let users decide which they want.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Jun-09 11:26:08 by karpel:</em> <br/>\n\nReady for accuracy review, assigning to TJ since we've talked about this in the past.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Jun-23 17:26:05 by karpel:</em> <br/>\n\nThis commit has ended up in the <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7690\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7690'); return false;\" title=\"Deprecate old, bad Python interfaces\">#7690</a></span> branch, so the branch named for this ticket will not need to be merged on its own.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Jul-28 12:32:48 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE_REVIEW</strong> changes look good.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Jun-09 11:25</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/891763aaf2b848dc08beb61259be04105fb3fb9f\">[59828]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7656\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7656'); return false;\" title=\"Tradeoffs between query and xquery should be made clear in the docs\">#7656</a></span>) clarify differences between Schedd.query and Schedd.xquery; move Schedd.xquery to appear next to Schedd.query in the source  (By Josh Karpel )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2020-Jul-28 12:42", "status": "resolved", "created": "2020-May-21 17:23", "fixed_version": "2020-May-21 17:23", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "PythonBinding", "assigned_to": "karpel", "derived_from": "", "creator": "karpel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
