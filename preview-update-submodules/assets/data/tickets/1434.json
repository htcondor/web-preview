However, if it isn't running, or there are more errors with a\nlarge enough schedd_sql.log file that in one bulk load you fill the disk,\nyou get screwed.\n\n</p><p>The fix we're thinking of at this time is to simply stop appending the\nlog file into the table and fill that entry with a \"N/A\" string or some\nsuch thing when it happens. We need to rethink why that code was storing\nthe entire log like this.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Aug-23 17:42:37 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070403 to v070404 using ./ticket_target_mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Sep-29 12:16:04 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nMade it so that the schedd_sql.log file is NEVER inserted into the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LogBody\" title=\"Log Body\">LogBody</a></span> column in a row in the Error_SqlLogs table.
