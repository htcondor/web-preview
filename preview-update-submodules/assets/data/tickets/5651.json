{"id": 5651, "title": "Ticket #5651: Consider using signals for atomic checkpoint transfer.", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhile forcing the user to ensure that restarting their job works is a nifty property of the current checkpointing in vanilla universe strategy, some jobs will have high start-up costs.  Our current plan is to just checkpoint these jobs less often, amortizing that cost.\n\n<p>In case that ends up not working out for our users, we should start contemplating a system where the job signals the starter that it's time to do file transfer, and the starter signals the job when it's time to resume.  The correctness issue that the process terminating itself solves is the one of ensuring that the checkpoint doesn't change while it's being transferred.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Apr-17 19:42:10 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nAlso consider using chirp commands.
