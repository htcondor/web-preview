{"id": 999, "title": "Ticket #999: Document IwdFlushNFSCache Job Ad attribute", "description": "<blockquote>\nA Job Ad attribute introduced in 7.4.0, IwdFlushNFSCache is an expression defaulting to TRUE. It controls the Condor feature of attempting to flush a submit node's NFS cache to refresh a job's IWD.  The feature is currently implemented by the condor_schedd, but could be implemented by the condor_shadow in the future. The goal of the feature it to allow files written by the job into an NFS mounted IWD to be immediately visible on the submit node. For instance, if a process is managing the job's presence in the Schedd, such as a meta-scheduler, needs access to the job's output written to the job's IWD and does not perform NFS cache flushing itself (why it doesn't is unknown), then Condor can perform the cache flushing on behalf of the process. This flushing operation can be expensive, requiring multiple round trips with the NFS server. In 7.4.0, the only way to disable the flushing if a job's IWD is on NFS and the provided semantics are not required is to +IwdFlushNFSCache=FALSE.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Dec-15 11:35</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/7458e5734b38e3cf6e756c512dbfaa4c0dee55a3\">[25184]</a></span>: additions to define and describe new job attribute IwdFlushNFSCache (gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=999\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('999'); return false;\" title=\"Document IwdFlushNFSCache Job Ad attribute\">#999</a></span>)  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2009-Dec-15 11:38", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Nov-25 06:25", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-25 06:25", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "#921", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
