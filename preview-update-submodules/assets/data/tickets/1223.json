So they are to be moved back into the man page, with a duplicate inclusion as section 2.5.1.  One file to maintain, 2 inclusions within the manual.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nIn the end, went with 1 file, located with the man pages, and referenced only by the condor_submit manual page.  Prose within the Users' Manual refers to the man page, and suggest using the Submit Commands index entry for lookup.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Feb-17 14:49</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f55bb15185cfeec89b9e8522d57d17308d6e0bf6\">[25288]</a></span>: descriptions of submit commands moved to the condor_submit man page (gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1223\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1223'); return false;\" title=\"move submit file commands back to condor_submit man page\">#1223</a></span>)  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2010-Feb-17 14:54", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Feb-17 11:11", "fixed_version": "2010-Feb-17 11:11", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
