How common are they? Is there a subset of tests that are problematic?  This will give us some guidance for how best to fix them.  Perhaps there are just a few we can fix individually, or perhaps it's a pervasive problem that requires a higher level fix.\n\n<p>Dan is doing the initial week of monitoring.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:17", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2010-Jan-28 14:09", "fixed_version": "2010-Jan-28 14:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "#1124", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
