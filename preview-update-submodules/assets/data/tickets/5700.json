{"id": 5700, "title": "Ticket #5700: Don't send schedd restart report for new schedds.", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe BaTLab starts up a new schedd for each job.  I've configured that schedd (the \"C2\" schedd, which runs the DAG which is the user's actual job) to report to me if anything terrible happens to it as a debugging measure.  However, the the schedd sends it restart report even on its initial start-up (not even that there aren't any jobs in the log, but that the log file doesn't even exist yet).  I'm turning off the restart report for now (because of the e-mail tsunami), but I'd like to be able to turn it back on in case the schedd ever really does restart.  So the feature request is to not send the restart report if this start is the first one -- e.g., if the job queue log doesn't exist (it'd probably be OK/better to not send if it were empty, as well).</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2016-May-27 14:54", "status": "new", "created": "2016-May-27 14:54", "fixed_version": "2016-May-27 14:54", "broken_version": "v080305", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#4783", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, jfrey@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
