{"id": 103, "title": "Ticket #103: Build/Test web pages: Clean up design", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe current design for the Condor build/test web pages is garish and busy.  It's so busy that it's easy to overlook information, and it's a bit of an eyestrain.  Reconsider the design and see if we can improve it.\n\n<p>A few possible improvements, using <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://nmi-s006.cs.wisc.edu/results/Run-condor-branch.php?branch=trunk&amp;user=cndrauto\">this page</a> as an example:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>The individual result cells have sub-tables with their own frames, creating a noisy double-frame effect.  Remove the inner frame.\n</li><li>The individual result cells have sub-tables with their dividing lines.  Do we need those lines for a little 3x2 table?\n</li><li>Do we need to screen success in such a bold green?  Maybe mute it to a faint green.  Maybe just the page's background color?  The same goes for individual pages like <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://nmi-s006.cs.wisc.edu/results/Run-condor-cross-details.php?runid=127499&amp;platform=nmi:x86_rhas_3&amp;user=cndrauto\">this one</a>; the existance of a \"0\" in the cell may be enough to distinguish between \"success\" and \"no result at all\", both of which are considered acceptable.\n</li><li>Again looking at <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://nmi-s006.cs.wisc.edu/results/Run-condor-cross-details.php?runid=127499&amp;platform=nmi:x86_rhas_3&amp;user=cndrauto\">this one</a>, do individual result numbers need to be bold?  Perhaps only bold failures?</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-21 10:59", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-23 17:23", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-23 17:23", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "#99", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
