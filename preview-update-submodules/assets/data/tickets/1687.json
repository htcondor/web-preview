{"id": 1687, "title": "Ticket #1687: LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE doesn't allow filenames containing commas or spaces", "description": "<blockquote>\nwhen condor_config parses the LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE list, it tokenizes on spaces and commas without regard to quotes.  This makes it impossible to use a pathname or filename that contains spaces (or commas).
