{"id": 1306, "title": "Ticket #1306: Stop/Start daemons on a master reconfig", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere is currently no way to have the master start/stop daemons w/o completely restarting the master.  This can cause a bit system impact if you are trying to add an additional schedd, or other such daemon, to improve scalability.  It would be nice if a reconfig sent to the master would start/stop daemons if DAEMON_LIST has changed.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Mar-24 13:21:34 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nI see the following line with no indent.

Am I wrong?\n\n<p>What happens if MASTER is removed from DAEMON_LIST.  Preferably, it would EXCEPT rather than having undefined behavior via references to Daemons::master ;-)\n\n</p><p>It looks like daemons are only removed if <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StartDaemons\" title=\"Start Daemons\">StartDaemons</a></span> is true at reconfig time.  So if I do condor_off, remove something from DAEMON_LIST, and then do condor_on, will it start up the daemon that I just removed from the list?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-29 16:46:37 by rrati:</em> <br/>\n\nIf the user does a condor_off, removes daemons but does NOT do a reconfig, then does a condor_on then master will be working off the old config values and any changes made (DAEMON_LIST or otherwise) would be ignored.\n\n<p>I'll test what happens is master is removed from the daemon list.  If it doesn't EXCEPT, I'll make it.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-29 17:01:56 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nMy comment about changes to DAEMON_LIST when <code>StartDaemons</code> is false should have read like this: if I do condor_off, remove something from DAEMON_LIST, then do condor_reconfig, and then do condor_on, will it start up the daemon that I just removed from the list?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-30 08:10:44 by rrati:</em> <br/>\n\nNo.  If you do a reconfig after a condor_off, the daemon_list will be updated correctly and the condor_on will only start the daemons currently listed in DAEMON_LIST.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-30 08:35:05 by rrati:</em> <br/>\n\nWhen MASTER is removed from the daemon_list and then a reconfig is done, the master will still be running.  The master is special cases, and will not be allowed to be shut down part from explicitly stopping the master (kill, condor_off -master, etc).  I've tested removing removing the special casing from master and found that in the above scenario (and all others involving a reconfig), the master will be stopped as any other daemon would be (thus shutting down all daemons).  If condor is attempted to be started again w/o adding MASTER back into DAEMON_LIST, the master will EXCEPT.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-30 09:45:15 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, so if I understand correctly, the reason why off, reconfig, on works is that although daemons that have been removed are still in Daemons::daemon_ptr, they are not listed in \"ordered_daemon_names\".  The only place I see where anything is removed from daemon_ptr is in StopDaemon().  It seems odd that this is only done during reconfig if <code>StartDaemons</code> is true.  Why not just always do it?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-30 11:25:29 by rrati:</em> <br/>\n\nOriginally I wasn't stopping the daemons explicitly unless <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StartDaemons\" title=\"Start Daemons\">StartDaemons</a></span> == TRUE because it didn't make sense to process the changes to DAEMON_LIST and stop the removed items if all the daemons were going to be shut down anyway.  Looking at the code, the stopping of daemons allows for the resources used by the daemon class to leak.  I've modified the code to free the resources for daemons that are shut off by changes to DAEMON_LIST.  <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StopDaemon\" title=\"Stop Daemon\">StopDaemon</a></span> is now called every time a reconfig is done.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/149/master_start_stops_daemons_on_reconfig.patch\">master_start_stops_daemons_on_reconfig.patch</a>\n30201 bytes added by rrati on 2010-Mar-24 15:05:04 UTC.\n<br/>\nThe master will start/stop daemons listed on DAEMON_LIST on a reconfig if DAEMON_LIST has changed since in the configuration (startup or previous reconfig)<br/>\n</li><li><a href=\"../files/150/master_start_stops_daemons_on_reconfig.patch\">master_start_stops_daemons_on_reconfig.patch</a>\n29911 bytes added by rrati on 2010-Mar-25 15:45:53 UTC.\n<br/>\nRevised patch based upon feedback.
