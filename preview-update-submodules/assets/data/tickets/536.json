There is no notice to indicate there is a problem.  There should be some notice made.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Where this came up:</h2>\n\n<p>In CHTC I missed a '\\' on one line, after pusing out the config change on a test node, I saw the daemons were continueing to run (The automatic condor_reconfig failed because of the config error, but I missed that in the noise from cfengine).\n\n</p><p>If I would have executed one client utility I would have seen my error, but I didn't. There was no messages from condor letting me know that starters were dying.\n\n</p><p>Despite my errors, I talked it over with DanB and it certainly sounds like we should give some kind of notice if starters are immediately dying, so I made this ticket.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jun-04 10:39", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-04 10:39", "broken_version": "v070301", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "khahn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "khahn@cs.wisc.edu danb@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
