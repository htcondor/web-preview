{"id": 3647, "title": "Ticket #3647: init.d script improvements for condor rpm", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently some users (notably Fermilab) customize their init.d script for HTCondor.  These customizations get blown away on upgrades because the script is not marked as a config file in the RPM.\n\n<p>One option was to mark the script as %config(noreplace), but this was turned down in favor of fixing the limitations of the init.d script and providing a proper place for customizations.\n\n</p><p>In particular, we would like to provide for the following:\n</p><ol>\n<li>add a ulimit statement to boost the number of allowed file descriptors\n</li><li>add a new command to the init script, service condor drain, which\nsends a condor_off -peaceful to the condor_master on the node\n</li><li>fix the /var/lock/subsys file so it is the correct  name.  Otherwise\nthe redhat shutdown script doesn't even attempt to shut down condor at\nsystem shutdown, which can lead to a virtual machine hang if you are running\ncondor in a VM.</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-May-21 13:53:55 by edquist:</em> <br/>\n\nSee attached email from Steve Timm describing his usage scenario / need for these improvements.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-21 14:05:53 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nAbandoning this ticket, as it is 95% a dup of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"review\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3450\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3450'); return false;\" title=\"problems with the RPM condor init script\">#3450</a></span>.
