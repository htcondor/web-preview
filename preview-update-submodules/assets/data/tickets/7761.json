{"id": 7761, "title": "Ticket #7761: Document SlotEval function in the startd", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs part of fixing <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7588\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7588'); return false;\" title=\"cross-slot posting of p-slot Child attrs needs work to be reliable\">#7588</a></span>, a new classad function SlotEval() was introduced.  This function is implemented only in the condor_startd.  It exists to provide a way to allow expressions in the startd to reference attributes of other slots while evaluating policy expressions.\n\n<p>This is intended to replace STARTD_SLOT_ATTRS.  it provides information that is more directed, and also more up-to-date.\n\n</p><p>This strategy has not yet had a chance to be tested in the CHTC pool.  Until it has, we will not document it. Once we are satisfied with the way it works, we should documen the use, scope and restrictions of SlotEval().</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:12", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Jul-28 13:29", "fixed_version": "2020-Jul-28 13:29", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#7588", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
