For instance, the platform_post step isn't run if the platform_job (the GT5 job) fails.  According to Jaime, this is simply unimplemented (as opposed to broken).\n\n</p><p>Metronome can fake this in a DAGMan postcript (probably); this will probably be even more troublesome for other users.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Mar-05 12:29", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Mar-05 12:28", "fixed_version": "2013-Mar-05 12:28", "broken_version": "v070901", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
