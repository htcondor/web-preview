Generally it preserves the format on delegation, but for an End Entity Credential it generates a draft-RFC version.  It was hypothesized that some services may not accept this format and we should generate an RFC 3820 compliant one instead.\n\n</p><p>This would be a simple rework of the switch statement in <code>condor_utils/globus_utils.cpp:x509_send_delegation()</code>\n\n</p><p>Probably we'll create yet another know to control this behavior, set the default in stable to the old behavior and change the default in devel to the new behavior.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:43:03 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080808 to v080809 using ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-May-12 10:56:49 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nCondor is using the pre-RFC form of the credential and should fix it, but LIGO is moving away from x509 so dropping the priority.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Oct-12 10:04", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Mar-27 14:26", "fixed_version": "2020-Mar-27 14:26", "broken_version": "v080800", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, jfrey.cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
