{"id": 6319, "title": "Ticket #6319: create command-line tool to push cred to the credd without submitting", "description": "<blockquote>\nCreate a command-line tool that pushes a new credential to the credd without actually submitting a job.  Perhaps this can be implemented simply as a flag to condor_submit.\n\n<p>The purpose of this tool is to keep credentials fresh in the case where a job has sat in the queue a long time and although the user has nothing else to submit at the moment, wishes to refresh the credential associated with the existing jobs.\n\n</p><p>It turns out that this is trivially done using the -dry option to condor_submit.  So we don't need to create a new tool in the codebase.  People who need this functionality should create a shell script (code below).  Ultimately we may include something like this in the actual codebase, but we are waiting to see how things develop in actual use before committing to the name and usage of the command that we might be stuck with.\n\n</p><p><code>condor_refresh_cred</code>\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">#!/bin/sh\n\ncondor_submit - -dry /dev/null $1 &gt; /dev/null &lt;&lt; EOF\nexecutable = /bin/true\nqueue\nEOF\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2017-Aug-14 14:54", "status": "resolved", "created": "2017-Jun-26 11:33", "fixed_version": "2017-Jun-26 11:33", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cern", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, christoph.beyer@desy.de", "due_date": ""}
