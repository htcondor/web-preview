The more interesting thing is defining what's the difference between devel, testing, prerelease, and release, especially since we're dealing with HTCondor and Blahp versions in these tarballs.\n\n<p>OSG is going to be more interested in the Blahp bits: I don't think we've ever had issues with the FT-Gahp or any other HTCondor bits in any of our Hosted CE deployments. So per-blahp commit tarballs + releases would be what we're most interested in.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Nov-09 12:04:17 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nI think this was done under HTCONDOR-21</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-11 09:08", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2020-Sep-02 11:41", "fixed_version": "2020-Sep-02 11:41", "broken_version": "", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tim", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "blin@cs.wisc.edu matyas@cs.wisc.edu bbockelman@morgridge.org", "due_date": ""}
