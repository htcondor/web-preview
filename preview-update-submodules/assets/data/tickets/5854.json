We probably should have checked to make sure MAIL exists and is executable first, and we should certainly have let dprintf() know not to use its FDs.  Or maybe we should just not attempt to log anything for this kind of failure?  I don't know if the dprintf code is expected / can be made to work in this sort of situation.\n\n<p>Initially observed in the V8_5-gt5767-branch branch, but verified to occur in master.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Aug-19 13:41:44 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThe function email_open_implementation() in condor_utils/email.cpp (line 323) doesn't use DaemonCore::Create_Process() and maybe should.\n\n<p>The EXCEPT() that causes the dprint_failure.SCHEDD to file to be created is on line 448.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Aug-25 16:45:44 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI'd say email_open() should be changed to use my_popen().
