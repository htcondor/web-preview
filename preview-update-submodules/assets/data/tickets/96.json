{"id": 96, "title": "Ticket #96: NFS check in schedd done as wrong user", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen a job completes, the schedd checks whether its IWD is on NFS. If it is, then the schedd creates and unlinks a file in the directory. This forces the NFS client to sync with the server, ensuring any files created or modified on the execute machine appear when the schedd scans the directory.\n\n<p>The schedd does its check of the directory being on NFS as user condor. Thus, if any parent directory doesn\u2019t have any global permissions enabled, the check will fail, even if the directory is on NFS.\n\n</p><p>The schedd does switch uids to the job owner to do the file create/unlink. This patch moves the uid switch to before the NFS check.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jan-23 16:53:48 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom matt (originally in Drupal):\n\n<p>Why even try to detect NFS?
