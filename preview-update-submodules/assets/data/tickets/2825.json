{"id": 2825, "title": "Ticket #2825: [Debian] Better support for Debian-derived distros", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn several places in the build system, we perform special steps if the OS is Debian, or if the OS is Ubuntu or Debian. The check performed at these points should be whether the OS appears to be Debian-derived. This will simplify Condor being built on these distros and hence becoming available as a native package.\n\n<p>The check for Debian-ness doesn't need to be perfect. It must work for Debian and Ubuntu (the two most common Debian-like distros) and should be likely to work for other Debian-derived distros. Here are some candidates:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>Check for existence of <code>/usr/bin/dpkg</code>\n</li><li>Check for existence of <code>/etc/debian_version</code></li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Mar-08 01:43:12 by mih:</em> <br/>\n\nMost Debian-derived releases after 2009 should support the 'dpkg-vendor' command that allow querying distribution-specific information. For example: who is the vendor? Is this a Debian-derived OS? ...\n\n<p>Just in case you need something more specific in the future.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Mar-08 02:58:09 by mih:</em> <br/>\n\nI can confirm that with the associated patch applied the Debian package of Condor now also builds fine on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Feb-14 13:38</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/a416ceb5e0c7a68e60fc205846ec997af5d8f601\">[30601]</a></span>: Better support for miscellaneous Linux distros. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2825\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2825'); return false;\" title=\"[Debian] Better support for Debian-derived distros\">#2825</a></span> Attempt to guess the name of linux distros that we don't explicitly check for.
