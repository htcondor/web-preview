{"id": 2160, "title": "Ticket #2160: Avoid having to truncate node job user log files", "description": "<blockquote>\nRight now DAGMan truncates a node job log file to zero length the first time it \"sees\" it in a run.  (This is done because we haven't implemented a way for DAGMan to filter out events in a log file that don't belong to the current run.)\n\n<p>Anyhow, it would be really nice if we could avoid this truncation, for several reasons:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>  * Avoid erasing history that might be useful.\n  * Avoid having log file \"collisions\" be a fatal error.\n</pre>\n\n<p>To do this we'd have to add some extra info to the log file events so that any DAGMan instance could identify the events that belong to it.  One idea is to add the DAGMan's condor ID, and maybe the schedd name.  (One issue with this is that we'd have to do some special work to make recovery mode work correctly if the recovering DAGMan had a different condor ID than the original one.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2645\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2645'); return false;\" title=\"Maintain DAGMan state in a better way\">#2645</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nMaintain DAGMan state in a better way</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Sep-08 15:57", "status": "stalled", "created": "2011-May-14 12:02", "fixed_version": "2011-May-14 12:02", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#445", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
