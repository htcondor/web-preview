{"id": 910, "title": "Ticket #910: Master hard to kill during restart", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf the master fails to re-exec itself, it sits in a loop sleeping between retries, never returning to daemon-core. This makes it impossible to kill it with anything sort of a kill -9. A condor_off -master or kill -15 should be able to make it exit.\n\n<p>During an upgrade of the UW-CS pool, the wrapper script around condor_master went missing on a few machines. The master sat in a loop occasionally trying to exec the missing file. The CSL tried stopping Condor with the init script and a kill -15, both of which had no effect.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 06:17", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Nov-04 14:48", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-04 14:48", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "s7853", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
