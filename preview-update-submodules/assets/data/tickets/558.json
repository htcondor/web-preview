Oftentimes I want to see if a rust ticket has an associated gittrac ticket, but since the extra1 field, where we keep the ticket number, isn't searched by default, I can't easily look.\n\n<p>It'd be nice if there were additional check boxes which held the symbolic name of the extra fields that I could check and have the search also act there as well. Of course, the check boxes should only appear when the fields are actually used.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 08:44", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jun-11 15:55", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-11 15:55", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "#3", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
