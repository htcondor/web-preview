{"id": 2182, "title": "Ticket #2182: Filter \"no idle jobs\" submitters prior to phase 4.1", "description": "<blockquote>\nSubmitterlimit calculations are based upon the entire set of users, even those\nwith \"no idle jobs\". In cases with a large number of \"no idle job\" submitters within a group, Phase 4.x (particularly 4.1) does no work. The Submitterlimit value will be too low for submitters that would match slots. Pruning these submissions prior to phase 4.1 will improve performance</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nReplaced by <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2194\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2194'); return false;\" title='Filter \"no idle jobs\" submitters prior to phase 4.1'>#2194</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-May-27 14:51", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2011-May-20 14:31", "fixed_version": "2011-May-20 14:31", "broken_version": "v070506", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "eje", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jrt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "eje@redhat.com, matt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
