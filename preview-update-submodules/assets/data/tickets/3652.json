{"id": 3652, "title": "Ticket #3652: fix condor-procd dependency on the rest of condor", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe condor-procd sub-package was intended to be a stand-alone, but the dependencies are such that installing condor-procd (with yum) pulls in the rest of condor.  Apparently this is due to it requiring the <code>libcondor_utils</code> shared lib.\n\n<p>Look into the specifics of why this happens and if possible fix the dependencies so it can stand alone.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-May-21 18:19:17 by edquist:</em> <br/>\n\nThe main issue seems to be that condor-procd uses libcondor_utils_%{version}.so, which is part of the main condor package.  Maybe we can put that library into its own sub-package?  (something like condor-libs?)\n\n<p>Additionally, condor-procd uses libclassad.so.3, which is part of condor-classads.  This is less of a big deal, since condor-classads can stand alone, but we should probably add the dependency explicitly to require condor-classads instead of implicitly with the autoreqs.\n\n</p><p>Attaching a dependency graph for the condor-* packages/libs.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-21 19:45:02 by edquist:</em> <br/>\n\nActually it looks like this is fixed in 7.9.6 (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1986\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1986'); return false;\" title=\"procd_ctl and gidd_alloc include unnecessary deps\">#1986</a></span>)</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/739/condor-deps.png\">condor-deps.png</a>\n100377 bytes added by edquist on 2013-May-21 23:20:36 UTC.\n<br/>\nDependency graph for condor-* packages / libs.\n<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-May-22 17:44", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2013-May-21 14:42", "fixed_version": "2013-May-21 14:42", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "edquist", "derived_from": "#3638", "creator": "edquist", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "edquist@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
