Fix is to run the path through the condor_dirname function, which checks for a trailing slash and removes it.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Oct-05 15:42:30 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nThere is an easy workaround (just change the config file), and the one line patch isn't a comprehensive fix, so we are going to defer this and work one a more comprehensive fix later. -tj\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:19:13 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/213/dcmain.patch\">dcmain.patch</a>\n504 bytes added by ziliang on 2010-Aug-12 20:08:56 UTC.\n<br/>\nOne line patch which fixes the issue.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jan-28 15:24", "status": "defer", "created": "2010-Aug-12 15:07", "fixed_version": "2010-Aug-12 15:07", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#1576", "creator": "ziliang", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": "20100816"}
