{"id": 4103, "title": "Ticket #4103: Starter post scripts should be able to easily get job exit status", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs far as I can figure out, there's no easy way for a starter post script to get the corresponding job's exit status, the way DAGMan post scripts can.  It seems like this would be really useful.\n\n<p>(What prompts me to think this is an email on htcondor-users -- the user basically only wants to see output if their job fails.  If a starter post script could easily get the job's exit status, it could just delete unwanted files if the job succeeded, which would pretty much do what this user wants.  I'm sure they could write a starter post script that would do this, but it would have to detect \"out of band\" whether the job succeeded or failed.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Dec-06 10:14", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Dec-06 10:14", "fixed_version": "2013-Dec-06 10:14", "broken_version": "v080004", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
