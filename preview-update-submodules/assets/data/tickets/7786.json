Removing a job implies that the job is finished. However when we shut down a job, we assume that we'll want to resume that job at a later point, picking up from the state where it left off.\n\n</p><p>We'll need to make new tools for this feature, presumably called <code>condor_shutdown</code> and <code>condor_resume</code>.\n\n</p><p>This work is described in detail in a design document: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O1dcSDclEp_gN5IkHza4TKtkjT5nJCjYveD1IA-hnfs/edit#\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O1dcSDclEp_gN5IkHza4TKtkjT5nJCjYveD1IA-hnfs/edit#</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:11", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Aug-05 15:46", "fixed_version": "2020-Aug-05 15:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "#7600", "creator": "coatsworth", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
