{"id": 4503, "title": "Ticket #4503: Concurrency allowing too many jobs , one sched", "description": "<blockquote>\nI am pretty positive this is a bug. For static slots with concurrency limits greater then 1 and if you start those jobs from a single submit file, you will periodically get 1 extra job running. I am unsure if you have N more jobs then\nthe concurrency limit allows if more then one extra jobs starts to run. If one submits the jobs slowly, the concurrency limits are correct.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2014-Jul-31 15:34", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Jul-31 15:34", "fixed_version": "2014-Jul-31 15:34", "broken_version": "v080202", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "tannenba", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bt@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
