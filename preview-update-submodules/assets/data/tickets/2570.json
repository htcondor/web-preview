For efficiency, we no longer insert these attributes into the machine ad every time we are about to evaluate a match.  Instead, we do the insertion once per cycle.  Any information that is dynamic (e.g. usage) is handled via a callout to a custom classad function.  I don't think your new attributes will require any fancy treatment.

Erik, assigning the ticket back to you, please address the pithy code review items and push.
