I think the\nexample would be clearer if proper names were not mixed with user names.\nI'm not too familiar with the musicians' names used as examples, and had\nto keep going back to remember which first name went with each last name\n(the usernames are the same as the last names).\n\n</p><p>I think the example would work well if you used only usernames.\n\n</p><p>-Mick\n\n</p><p>From Karen:\nMick is right that this section should be clarified.  Derek's choice of the quartet is amusing, but the prose forgets to use their last names, forcing the reader of this section to remember instruments, first names, and last names.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Oct-19 13:10</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/9dd3777ca32e10c62148f753c65448bd8f5cfc8d\">[27898]</a></span>: clarify Rank examples ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2485\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2485'); return false;\" title=\"clarify who is who in manual's RANK description example\">#2485</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2011-Oct-19 14:57", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Sep-21 11:57", "fixed_version": "2011-Sep-21 11:57", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "a22302", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
