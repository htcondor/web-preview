In particular:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>HOOK_FETCH_WORK is told the slot. It seems like a good thing to use to generate unique-to-the-machine identifiers, but it's useless with partitionable slots since everyone will be told \"1\".  May be okay, just worth calling out.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Is HOOK_REPLY_FETCH told the sub-slot information?  Even if it is, is it too late to be useful, because the startd will not wait for it to return.\n\n<p></p></li><li>HOOK_PREPARE_JOB would be a good place to handle this, but it's not given the slot classad at all.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2012-Jul-26 16:49", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jul-26 16:49", "fixed_version": "2012-Jul-26 16:49", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
