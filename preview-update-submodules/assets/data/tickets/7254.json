We are going to start deploying this at CIT tomorrow. The current/original STARTD will continue to run a single pslot and the new HIPRIO_STARTD will run a single static slot. Both will advertise all of the system CPUs, but we will make a hard partition of memory between the two to avoid oversubscription/swapping. How do we scope SLOT_TYPE_X_Y statements to bind them to one startd versus the other?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n&gt; On Sep 30, 2019, at 8:24 PM, Greg Thain &lt;gthain@cs.wisc.edu&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the configuration for two startds on a single condor machine -- I'd need a bit more info from you about how you'd like them configured:  pslots or static slots, etc.  I have verified that jobs go into different cgroups, but haven't done much testing to see how well the cgroups isolate the cpu usage:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; basically, add the HIPRIO_START to your DAEMON_LIST\n&gt;\n&gt; DAEMON_LIST                     = MASTER, STARTD, HIPRIO_STARTD\n&gt;\n&gt; then add the following lines to the config file:\n&gt;\n&gt; HIPRIO_STARTD = $(STARTD)\n&gt; HIPRIO_STARTD_ARGS = -f -local-name HIPRIO_STARTD\n&gt; HIPRIO_STARTD_ENVIRONMENT = \"_CONDOR_STARTER_LOG=$(STARTER_LOG).hiprio _CONDOR_PROCD_ADDRESS=$(PROCD_ADDRESS).hiprio _CONDOR_BASE_CGROUP=hiprio\"\n&gt; HIPRIO_STARTD.STARTD_LOG = $(STARTD_LOG).hiprio\n&gt; HIPRIO_STARTD.STARTD_ADDRESS_FILE = $(STARTD_ADDRESS_FILES).hiprio\n&gt; HIPRIO_STARTD.EXECUTE = $(EXECUTE).hiprio\n&gt; HIPRIO_STARTD.STARTD_NAME = HIPRIO_STARTD\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Then in /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/hiprio, set cpu.shares to some very large number, say 100,000.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Oct-08 10:36:34 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nShould we also increase the i/o priority of the high-priority slot?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Oct-20 19:37:22 by anderson:</em> <br/>\n\nThe following configuration looks like it is working to give priority multi-threaded jobs a 100:1 ratio of CPU time over background HTC jobs, and to add a hard limit to memory usage by the priority processes. This is currently running on 2 nodes at CIT for testing, and will be scaled out to qty 100 24-core nodes on Tues (Oct 22).\n\n<p>So far, it has been it has been confirmed that OpenMP jobs that take 3-sec when run interactively on identical hardware are also scheduled and complete execution via a Celery queue on top of Condor in &lt;4s, i.e., jobs are able to burst to 2-nodes and return their results with the goal of sub-second scheduling latency. The next test will be verify that scales to qty 100 parallel jobs, i.e., bursting to 2400-cores with sub-second latency and getting 99% of the kernel cpu-slices without disrupting HTC jobs already running on the same hardware.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">[root@node2060 ~]# cat /etc/systemd/system/condor.service.d/emfollow.conf\n[Service]\nMemoryAccounting = true\nExecStartPost    = /bin/bash -c \"cgcreate -g *:emfollow; cgset -r memory.limit_in_bytes=8G -r memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes=8G -r cpu.shares=102400 /emfollow\"\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">[root@node2060 ~]# cat /etc/condor/config.d/04-emfollow\n#\n# Configuration to add a second STARTD in a different cgroup for occasional\n# high priority EMFollow jobs to run--initial use case Bayestar sky map jobs.\n# Note, bayestar jobs do not need much memory so no need to reduce the mem\n# setting for the normal STARTD, but only advertise a small amount of memory\n# for the EMFOLLOW STARTD.\n#\n# For now a separte Condor systemd config file is used to create the initial\n# EMFOLLOW cgroup, set a small 2GB memory limit and give that collection of\n# processes a 100:1 ratio over \"regular\" condor jobs.
