Condor handled the condor_qedit just fine, but didn't handle the logging of the attribute changes well.  This IO backed up the schedd, caused SECMAN timeouts for clients, and caused matching failures from the negotiator to that schedd.\n\n<p>If a user streams job changes, we need the schedd to better stream the log output when there are multiple queued entries instead of doing the normal per-entry lock/write/unlock.  It was the repeated file locking per entry that caused the excessive slowness in this particular case today.\n\n</p><p>Furthermore, the user was adjusting the priority of all of their jobs to be the same (lower) priority to give space to their fellow teammates.  This mean that for some jobs the condor_edit was setting <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobPrio\" title=\"Job Prio\">JobPrio</a></span> to the same value it had been set to previously, but also logging that it set the value to the same value as previously.

It is supposed to just log events that change the job status, as needed for consumption by a meta-scheduler like dagman.  Maybe we should have a call to discuss the motivations for why this is needed downstream, or perhaps it could be written down along with requirements.  My point here is maybe the job event log is not the right mechanism to achieve the downstream requirement.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-12 09:14:42 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nDownstream customers consider this information to be important to their understanding of their workflow histories.

It was designed for auditing, unlike the event log which was designed for use by meta-schedulers like dagman and thus has all sorts of overhead for that purpose (like file locking, aggressive flushing to support 2PC, etc).  Compared to the event log, the audit log provides better auditing meta data (e.g. it actually logs <em>who</em> made the change, something the event log does not do), provides age-based time rotation, is designed to be easy to answer basic what/who/when questions via a simple grep (i.e. all important 'fields' for a record appear on the same line), is centralized so there is just one place to look and to make it easy to copy off to another server for safekeeping (security audit archiving), and logs more relevant \"audit\" information (see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3563\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3563'); return false;\" title=\"Schedd commands to audit\">#3563</a></span>).\n\n<p>Take the simple example of the admin wants to know when attribute foo changed from X to Y.  The schedd audit log can tell you no matter how that attribute got changed, be it via condor_qedit, or via non-obvious changes like condor_chirp or chirp updates from the job itself.\n\n</p><p>If the audit log does not audit something important downstream, I'd like to hear about it!\n\n</p><p>Especially given that a mechanism specifically designed for auditing exists, I am not convinced that auditing is a reason to keep around <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1791\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1791'); return false;\" title=\"condor_qedit and condor_prio changes should show up in the UserLog\">#1791</a></span>.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-12 14:40:12 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nI think the question is whether you're are a scientist or an admin -- the audit long is perfect for admin-centered questions involving everything that happens in the context a schedd, but a scientist wants to be able to keep a history of each of their individual workflows alongside the results -- i.e., exactly what the userlog does now.  I.e., the information for them isn't attached to a schedd, it's attached to a workflow.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-13 14:47:04 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nNothing concrete yet, but just a thought floating around in my head that is somewhat related to this discussion, so I thought I'd share -- I am thinking of perhaps getting rid of all the code in the schedd that writes to the event logs and consolidating it all into a separate daemon that would run alongside the schedd. This daemon would monitor the job_queue.log (just like the job_router daemon) and be responsible for updating all the various event logs.  This would keep the schedd from blocking all the time on event log locks, syncs, etc, and the increased concurrency from event log writing and regular schedd operations happening in parallel would hopefully improve scalability.  It would also simplify the code, enabling us to do more sophisticated/experimental event notification schemes without the worry/risk of breaking the already overly complicated schedd. Of course, all the event log semantics would have to be preserved, but a key here realizing that events in the log do not have to appear right away.  I.e. it is fine if the event logging daemon is a little bit \"behind\" the schedd, assuming that on the average it is able to keep up.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-15 12:10:25 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nI love that idea!\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Nov-15 13:44:58 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nDoes the job queue log embody all the information needed to preserve semantics of user log, audit log, etc?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-25 17:42:15 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nI have a patch that gets rid of redundant opening and closing of logs, via caching the structures that keep log files and their locks:\n\n<p>V8_1-gt4040-optimize-userlog\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-28 10:35:09 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nJust talked with ToddT about this -- we think we should have some numbers on how much this improves performance before deciding it's worthwhile to merge this.\n\n<p>How about this for a simple test?:  submit 100k jobs on hold, and then do some operation on them -- remove them, or change priority or something, and measure how long this takes with and without the caching.  I think you should be able to do that without having much in the way of resources.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-28 20:14:46 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nI did some experiments where I submitted 10,000 jobs, all sharing a log file, on hold into the queue.  Then I invoked condor_prio:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">$ condor_prio +1 eje</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I took 10 samples each for timings of condor_prio.\n\n</p><p>My first experiments I ran on all-local disk.   In this environment, the caching was about 2-3% faster.  A measurable improvement, but not huge.   Turning fsync on and off had a large effect on total time, but did not have much impact the improvements from the caching.\n\n</p><p>My second experiments I configured log files on an NFS mount.  In this case, the caching has a fairly large impact (although interestingly, turning fsync on and off had very little impact).\n\n</p><p>For these experiments, the condor_prio command had a mean execution time of 19.5 seconds with caching, and 30.4 seconds without.  So the mean performance is about 30% faster with caching.   The standard deviation with caching was 1.0 seconds, and without caching it was 2.5, so the caching also improved the consistency of the results: without the caching, I measured some substantial outliers with larger run times.  Turning off fsync made the times slightly better in favor of caching, but the difference was small enough to be not very significant.\n\n</p><p>Overall, the log file caching patch seems like a worthwhile performance improvement, particularly when logging over NFS.   I suspect that larger performance improvements might be possible on NFS mounts with higher latencies, or higher traffic.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-29 09:25:45 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nWhen testing on any rev where <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4111\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4111'); return false;\" title=\"Non-blocking response to condor_q\">#4111</a></span> is present, it may be useful to set:\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">CONDOR_Q_USE_V3_PROTOCOL = false</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>in the event that the new protocol makes it harder to assess the time it takes for a queue operation to complete.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Apr-01 17:47:51 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nAs an aside, I noticed a lot of 'creating directory' operations that look redundant, because the lock files themselves should have still been open.

If that was the problem, it's might be solvable by conditionally disabling compilation of that code in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=WriteUserLog\" title=\"Write User Log\">WriteUserLog</a></span> when building the shadow.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Apr-14 10:23:50 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nI think this patch is off the hook for the 200k increase in shadow size.  There appears to be a smaller increase due to this patch, an increase of about 60k on Rhel6 in the Batlab corresponds with the introduction of this patch in the master branch - this was causing the static shadow to fail the shadow memory size test. But the problem seems to have gone away in more recent builds on the master branch.\n\n<p>The gain of 120k is now occurring on the Rhel5 machine on master AND on the async transfer work branch which does not have this patch - so whatever his happening it isn't due to this commit.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-May-01 14:34</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/06977e07a9baccd653d9f64f5daea7a97f0ddf4a\">[40042]</a></span>: rewrite documentation of 2 new knobs such that their definition matches with what these knobs actually do. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4040\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4040'); return false;\" title=\"Optimize condor UserLog IO, via batching\">#4040</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Apr-22 17:28</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/5af98dca619b93532974fd212afa7e3142a8eb97\">[40019]</a></span>: Fix small memory leak in user log caching <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4040\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4040'); return false;\" title=\"Optimize condor UserLog IO, via batching\">#4040</a></span>  (By Greg Thain )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Apr-10 14:26</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/526998692b159cd8e3394c4eae8512710d9dc991\">[39898]</a></span>: version history for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4040\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4040'); return false;\" title=\"Optimize condor UserLog IO, via batching\">#4040</a></span>  (By Erik Erlandson )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Apr-10 14:21</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/b4a7657edfe662a47af0ef9462140ad055d6d9e2\">[39896]</a></span>: Use a cache of open userlog files (and locks) to improve efficiency of userlog output <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4040\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4040'); return false;\" title=\"Optimize condor UserLog IO, via batching\">#4040</a></span>  (By Erik Erlandson )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-Apr-10 14:21</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/af0eccb1f83886749d717f0b466b688653285362\">[39897]</a></span>: Document configuration parameters for userlog caching <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4040\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4040'); return false;\" title=\"Optimize condor UserLog IO, via batching\">#4040</a></span>  (By Erik Erlandson )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Apr-14 10:23", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Nov-04 16:09", "fixed_version": "2013-Nov-04 16:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "eje", "derived_from": "", "creator": "eje", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "eje@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu, gthain@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com, matt@cs.wisc.edu, jthomas@redhat.com, pfcouvar@syr.edu, wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
