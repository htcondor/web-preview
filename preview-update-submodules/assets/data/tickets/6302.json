{"id": 6302, "title": "Ticket #6302: file transfer of directories windows to linux directory delimiter bug", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom htcondor-users:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nI am currently running into an issue trying to transfer output from a\nWindows (2012R2) Exec back to a Linux (SLES11SP3) schedd.  The job creates\na directory named results in the condor execute directory and writes output\nthere.  Then based on the submit file Condor tries to copy the results\ndirectory back to the schedd.  However it looks like it gets confused about\nthe file name and ends up creating a file called results\\output.h5 on the\nschedd instead of putting output.h5 into the results directory.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>The full description on htcondor-users is available <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/htcondor-users/2017-June/msg00046.shtml\">here</a>.\n\n</p><p>This appears to be a case of HTCondor not properly understanding the directory delimiter (backwards vs forwards slash) when transferring the contents of directories, and requires a code patch to fix.  In the meantime, there is a work-around available to the end user by leveraging <code>transfer_output_remaps</code> in the job submit file.  For instance, to workaround the problem described above the user could put\n\n</p><p></p><pre>   transfer_output_remaps = \"results\\\\output.h5=results/output.h5\"\n</pre>\n\n<p>in their submit file.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Jun-14 10:25:29 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nThis has been a known issue for awhile.
