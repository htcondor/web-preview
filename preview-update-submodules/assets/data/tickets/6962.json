{"id": 6962, "title": "Ticket #6962: Test OpenSSL 1.1.0-only code in TOKEN authentication method", "description": "<blockquote>\nFedora 27 and Debian 9 (our two OpenSSL 1.1.0 platforms) both failed to build the TOKEN code as merged for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6947\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6947'); return false;\" title=\"Extend PASSWORD auth to support multiple and derived secrets\">#6947</a></span>.  Although the fixes appear to be trivial, I'm now worried that the OpenSSL 1.1.0 -specific code has never been tested.\n\n<p>Brian, I'd like to know what you did to test the other version of the code just because we need regression tests for the TOKEN code, but without that information, I think we'll have to disable the OpenSSL 1.1.0 -specific code until someone who knows crypto can take a good look at it.  I'm assuming here that the code for earlier version of OpenSSL will work for 1.1.0; if not, we'll need to disable the whole thing.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:46:13 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080906 to v080907 using ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 10:54", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Mar-20 15:46", "fixed_version": "2019-Mar-20 15:46", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#6947", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, bbockelman@morgridge.org, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
