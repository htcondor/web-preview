That means there are some bizarre and strange reuse issues going on here.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Sep-20 15:42:35 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nUpdate filtering within the collector tree may be contributing (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5913\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5913'); return false;\" title=\"Consider ClaimId in collector forward filter\">#5913</a></span>).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Sep-20 15:47:08 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nI don't think it's the problem here, but it seems that the assumption the claim ID is unique is dicey.  There's currently zero duplicated claim IDs, but 847 startds have identical IP addresses and startup times.  It seems this is exacerbated by the fact glideins startup frequently and IPs are commonly reused (i.e., at Docker sites or same IP space between different clusters).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Sep-20 16:01:45 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nNote that Claim ID <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1'); return false;\" title=\"Another Test\">#1</a></span> was used at13:50:29 by schedd IP *.51, then is attempted to be used again at 17:16:34 by schedd at IP *.47.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Sep-20 21:11:43 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nThere's no bizarre timeouts set.
