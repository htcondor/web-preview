You can see\nthe behavior in the attached <span class=\"quote\">SchedLog</span>, <span class=\"quote\">ShadowLog</span>, and <span class=\"quote\">StartdLog</span> files.\n\n</p><p>You can\nsee the scheduler start up the shadow for that job and match it to a\nslot2 on the execute node. And you can see the shadow and startd\ntalking. But it appears that there is a communication issue - possibly\nsecurity related - that causes the shadow to think it hasn't heard from\nthe startd and to then evict the job.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jul-09 16:32:14 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nlooked at the logs.  the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ShadowLog\" title=\"Shadow Log\">ShadowLog</a></span> shows failures occurring before the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StartLog\" title=\"Start Log\">StartLog</a></span> begins, and clock skew has been ruled out.  i requested more complete logs and also the D_FD be turned on.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Nov-17 10:46:49 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nthey long ago moved on to a different configuration and so were unable to supply more logs or logs with D_FD.  rust resolved, and i'm resolving this ticket as well.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2009-Dec-26 20:19", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jun-24 19:10", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-24 19:10", "broken_version": "v070005", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "s7810", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
