{"id": 42, "title": "Ticket #42: Altera ProcD performance problem", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom condor-users:\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">Matt, I backed out of my 7.0.x -&gt; 7.2.0 upgrade plan here at Altera but\nit wasn't because the binaries were non-functional. The new procd daemon\nthat takes care of thread clean up and improves privledge separation (or\nso the readme says) takes *forever* to kill off a job when a claim\npreempts a running job and it was causing havoc with our preemption\npolicy. I haven't had a chance to try 7.2.0 out with the no-procd option\nyet to see if things are sane.\n\n  - Ian\n</pre></div>\n\nWe should contact Ian and try to figure out and fix his issue.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jan-20 08:43:17 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nI've sent Ian e-mail in order to get moving on this.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jan-21 09:27:26 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nThis sounds very easy to reproduce.  Let's not wait for Ian to send us back info/logs if we can easily reproduce the problem here.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jan-23 10:17:42 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nBen has tried to reproduce this to no avail. I sent out an e-mail to condor-users saying that we are working with Altera on this and we've tried to reproduce it unsuccessfully, and also asking whether any other users are experiencing it. No responses yet.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Mar-27 13:04:20 by burnett:</em> <br/>\n\n\"Ben, sorry for the insane delay on this. Before I ripped apart my system to institute the hooks-based system I tried it out with 7.2.1.\n\n<p>I couldn't reproduce the problem. The preemption was occurring fast on Windows and my preemption-based policy was working. The request_claim_timeout timer was never timing out.\n\n</p><p>- Ian\"</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 08:23", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Jan-20 08:13", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-20 08:13", "broken_version": "v070200", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "burnett", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gquinn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
