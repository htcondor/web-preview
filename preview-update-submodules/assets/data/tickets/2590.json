{"id": 2590, "title": "Ticket #2590: collect CCB diagnostic stats", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe had a recent issue with network connectivity in a cluster at Purdue.  One in 5 TCP connection attempts failed, but we didn't notice without some trouble.  Currently, the daemon logs are the only record of such failures.  It would help debug this sort of situation if there were some aggregated statistics, perhaps kept by the CCB server.\n\n<p>Question: how should the statistics be grouped?  By domain name?  In this particular instance, the problem was with one cluster at Purdue, so domain name would have been too general, but it still would have been useful.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Jul-28 13:23", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Oct-26 12:55", "fixed_version": "2011-Oct-26 12:55", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu,bbockelm@cse.unl.edu,tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
