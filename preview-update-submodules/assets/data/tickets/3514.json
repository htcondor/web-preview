{"id": 3514, "title": "Ticket #3514: Cluster ads qedit'able via x.-1", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs an optimization, job ads are stored as a cluster ad + proc ad. If a job's id is 1.0 the cluster ad is 01.-1 and proc ad is 1.0.\n\n<p>It is possible to qedit the cluster ad using id 1.-1. All cluster ad changes are applied to every proc ad and thus every job ad in the cluster.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>$ echo queue 10 | condor_submit -a cmd=/bin/sleep -a args=1d -a requirements=false\nSubmitting job(s)..........\n10 job(s) submitted to cluster 1.\n\nIn ~condor/spool/job_queue.log -\n\n103 0.0 NextClusterNum 2\n101 01.-1 Job Machine\n101 1.0 Job Machine\n...\n\n$ condor_qedit 307.-1 requirements true\nSet attribute \"requirements\".\n\n$ condor_q 307 -l | grep ^Requirements\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\nRequirements = true\n\nIn ~condor/spool/job_queue.log -\n...\n105\n103 0307.-1 requirements true\n106\n...\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>It's not likely that this is intentional.
