{"id": 5048, "title": "Ticket #5048: Enable master to act as fully configurable glidein", "description": "<blockquote>\nThis concept came from Miron during a Blueprint discussion. If the master is submitted as an executable, create a scheme where it downloads a Condor binary distribution, installs it, configures it, and starts.\n\n<p>The idea is that the condor_master becomes a flexible glidein bootstrap stub.\n\n</p><p>Configuration info could come from command line arguments and/or a config file sent as part of the input sandbox.\n\n</p><p>A Python-based prototype exists (for usage with <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=AutoPyFactory\" title=\"Auto Py Factory\">AutoPyFactory</a></span>) which this Condor feature should make obsolete. But until then, the prototype can be used as a testbed to explore mechanisms, config, and features.\n\n</p><p><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/jhover/condor-glidein-wrapper\">https://github.com/jhover/condor-glidein-wrapper</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "experimental", "last_change": "2015-May-11 09:43", "status": "new", "created": "2015-May-11 09:43", "fixed_version": "2015-May-11 09:43", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonMaster", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jhover", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
