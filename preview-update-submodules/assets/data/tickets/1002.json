{"id": 1002, "title": "Ticket #1002: remove fallback to non-negotiated command protocol", "description": "<blockquote>\n<span class=\"quote\">SecMan</span> will fall back to the non-negotiated command protocol (aka raw command protocol) if the client fails to get a response to DC_AUTHENTICATE.  The assumption is that if we don't get a response then our peer must be pre 6.3.3, which means it doesn't understand DC_AUTHENTICATE.\n\n<p>The problem is that we may fail to get a response for reasons other than an old peer and by attempting to reconnect to the peer, we may block the current process and hurt performance.  Since we no longer care about compatibility with pre 6.3.3, this risk no longer seems worth the benefit of backward compatibility.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Nov-25 16:28</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/9b440e07566085fa715642d94d30a85539521dcc\">[25149]</a></span>: Documented removal of fall-back to non-negotiated command protocol. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1002\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1002'); return false;\" title=\"remove fallback to non-negotiated command protocol\">#1002</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Nov-25 13:48</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/4afcda3b8a448743c9b1162a3981670c562e5530\">[16458]</a></span>: Removed fall-back to non-negotiated command protocol. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1002\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1002'); return false;\" title=\"remove fallback to non-negotiated command protocol\">#1002</a></span> This means clients wishing to speak with pre 6.3.3 servers or servers configured not to allow security negotiation must set SEC_CLIENT_NEGOTIATION = NEVER  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:41", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Nov-25 13:55", "fixed_version": "2009-Nov-25 13:55", "broken_version": "v070500", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "#953", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
