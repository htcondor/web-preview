{"id": 6707, "title": "Ticket #6707: Fix handling of missing local config files", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen initializing Condor's config system, the caller can pass a flag that suppresses calls to exit() on errors. When this flag (CONFIG_OPT_NO_EXIT) is used, the initialization call returns false instead of calling exit(). This flag is doesn't affect the case where a required local config file is missing or unreadable. These errors do result in a call to exit() (except when using config_host() with a non-NULL host argument). This flag also doesn't affect parse errors, like a missing '=', which always cause an exit().\n\n<p>The use of CONFIG_OPT_NO_EXIT is dubious. If config_ex() returns false, then much of the initialization of the config system hasn't been done. The caller should abort or try to fix the problem and call config_ex() again. All current callers proceed as if config_ex() was successful.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-May-14 06:34", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Jun-28 16:16", "fixed_version": "2018-Jun-28 16:16", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
