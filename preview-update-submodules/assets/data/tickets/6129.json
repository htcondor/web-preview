{"id": 6129, "title": "Ticket #6129: Create mpich3 (hydra) scripts compatible with parallel universe", "description": "<blockquote>\nOpen MPI and MPICH2-compatible scripts were updated in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6024\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6024'); return false;\" title=\"Update/create MPI helper scripts for parallel universe jobs\">#6024</a></span>. MPICH3 uses the Hydra launcher (<em>not</em> MPD) which throws some wrenches into our usual methods (e.g. hijacking ssh commands from mpirun) for setting up the mpi execute proxies on the execute nodes. For example, Hydra ignores duplicate hostnames in the machines file, and it checks the hostname of connecting proxies against the hostnames in the machines file, so we probably can't just put dummy hostnames in the machines file as we've done with Open MPI.\n\n<p>There is maybe an opportunity to use a PMIx-based launcher/proxy system (does one exist?) instead of Hydra...?
