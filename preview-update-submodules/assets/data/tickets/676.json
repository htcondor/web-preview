This won't be able to make it into the 7.3.2 release, but we can add code allowing the user to tell the gridmanager whether a server is GRAM5. They can do this by setting the grid-type to 'gt5' in the <span class=\"quote\">GridResource</span> job attribute.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Aug-19 16:07:31 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe 'gt5' grid-type is intended as a temporary solution to distinguishing between GRAM2 and GRAM5 servers. Currently, the <span class=\"quote\">GridResource</span> or <span class=\"quote\">GridJobId</span> attribute of the first job seen by the gridmanager for a given server determines whether it treats the server as GRAM2 or GRAM5. So mixing the two grid-types for a given server results in undefined behavior.\n\n<p>If a server is ID'd as GRAM5, the gridmanager's behavior towards that server is changed as follows:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Grid Monitor is disabled.\n</li><li>Jobmanagers aren't stopped.\n</li><li>GRIDMANAGER_MAX_JOBMANAGERS_PER_RESOURCE isn't applied.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Aug-19 16:01</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/1a36fad8ae89322ca28fb3a43aa3c0ef9e8ccf7c\">[15406]</a></span>: Initial support for GRAM5, user has to ID servers.
