{"id": 1069, "title": "Ticket #1069: Schedd shows no responsiveness during negotiation", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe current negotiation cycle involves a single connection from the Negotiator to the Schedd, on which all jobs and matches are communicated. During the lifetime of the connection, the Schedd and Negotiator are unresponsive to user commands and other operations.\n\n<p>For the Negotiator, this is not a huge issue. It's primary function is to perform negotiation cycles. User commands requiring the Negotiator are condor_q -better-analyze and condor_userprio.\n\n</p><p>For the Schedd, this is a significant issue. The primary function for the Schedd is to accept and manage jobs. User commands effected are condor_submit (critical) and condor_q (less critical). Normal operation includes communication with Shadow processes and Startds. Loss of condor_submit functionality is a hindrance to user experience and burden to automated systems submitting to the Schedd. Loss of communication with Shadow processes and Startds can result in failures that effect throughput and overall system health.\n\n</p><p>For the Schedd, this issue can be resolved by allowing the Schedd to re-enter select during negotiation. Also, the negotiation protocol could be modified to become more asynchronous in general.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Plan </h2>\n\n<p>Miron wants just the following:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>Schedd's negotiation loop is changed to be asynchronous.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Schedd must support receiving matches \"out of the blue\", not just a match for the most recent job that was sent to the matchmaker.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Miron wants to see numbers showing the effect of this change before considering further changes, such as batching of job requests.\n\n</p><p>As we discussed, this plan is expected to reduce time spent by the schedd in negotiation, but it will likely <em>increase</em> time spent by the negotiator, since the negotiator may have to wait longer to get the next job from the schedd.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"section\"></span></p><h2>Results </h2>\n\n<p>I made the schedd's negotiation loop asynchronous.  I then ran simple tests against the ghost pool (7k slots) timing how much time is consumed in the schedd and the negotiator when matching 1000 jobs.\n\n</p><p><table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\nAsync</td>\n<td>\n<code>Matches</code></td>\n<td>\n<code>Jobs/Cluster</code></td>\n<td>\nSchedd Time</td>\n<td>\nNegotiator Time</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nno   </td>\n<td>\n1000     </td>\n<td>\n1000          </td>\n<td>\n10s        </td>\n<td>\n30s            </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nyes  </td>\n<td>\n1000     </td>\n<td>\n1000          </td>\n<td>\n10s        </td>\n<td>\n70s            </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nno   </td>\n<td>\n1000     </td>\n<td>\n10            </td>\n<td>\n330s       </td>\n<td>\n350s           </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nyes  </td>\n<td>\n1000     </td>\n<td>\n10            </td>\n<td>\n10s        </td>\n<td>\n390s           </td>\n</tr>\n\n</tbody></table>\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>Jobs/Cluster: number of jobs in each auto cluster\n</li><li>Schedd Time: time in which schedd was solely engaged in negotiation\n</li><li>Negotiator Time: time from start to stop of a negotiation cycle (in all cases, about 20s of this was spent pulling ads from the collector)\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Additional tests were run with the schedd having to work harder.  However, due to the need for more memory, I had to switch schedd machines.  The previous tests were done with the schedd running on my laptop.  The following tests were done with the schedd running on a server-class machine (c158.chtc.wisc.edu).\n\n</p><p>In conducting the following tests, I also discovered a scaling problem in auto clustering <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1665\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1665'); return false;\" title=\"search for existing auto cluster is O(N)\">#1665</a></span>.
