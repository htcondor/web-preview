{"id": 1368, "title": "Ticket #1368: New ClassAd function: regex_replace", "description": "<blockquote>\nA new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> function that returns the result of a search and replace would be handy.\n\n<p>I was asked if it's possible to basically re-implement condor_q, but with customizations for their particular queue.* I thought it was possible with -format, but it turns out it's not so easy.  In particular, condor_q shows the basename(Cmd), but <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> functions lack equivalent functionality.  \"basename(Cmd)\" would work, but seems overly specialized.  Instead, I'd like to do something like:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">condor_q -format '%s\\n' regex_replace(\".*/\", Cmd, \"\")\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>* For the curious, their jobs run under a wrapper, and seeing the CMD listed as \"our_wrapper\" wasn't helpful.  They want the displayed CMD to the Cmd if it's not our_wrapper.   If it is our_wrapper, look for the attribute real_command and display that.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:08:44 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:08", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Apr-21 15:33", "fixed_version": "2010-Apr-21 15:33", "broken_version": "v070402", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
