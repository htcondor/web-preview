A range of clusters should be allowed, or we could turn that check off entirely during the transform phase, since it is the schedd itself setting job attributes in that case.\n\n<p>But the real problem here is that each distinct submit object used in a transaction in a python script allocates a new cluster, while multiple QUEUE statements in a submit file normally do not, so this bug in the transform code is much easier to hit from python than it is from condor_submit.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Aug-09 10:06:31 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>This code looks good.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Aug-08 15:39</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/aa3fa268fc9362bbcc08e3c2b58f31156f535030\">[57633]</a></span>: fix <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7036\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7036'); return false;\" title=\"Cannot queue multiple times on a single transaction\">#7036</a></span> - python cannot queue multiple times in a single transaction. this is actually a bug with submit transforms when there are multiple clusters in the transform. ===VersionHistory:Complete===  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-Aug-12 15:19", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-May-06 12:19", "fixed_version": "2019-May-06 12:19", "broken_version": "v080803", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "PythonBinding", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "#6719", "creator": "karpel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "karpel@wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
