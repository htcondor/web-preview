{"id": 692, "title": "Ticket #692: local universe job with unwritable job log leaks spool directory", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf a local universe job is submitted, but cannot write to its job log, when it tries and fails to run it will leak a subdirectory at $SPOOL/local_univ_execute/dir_$PID .  Worse, the schedd complains:\n\n<p></p><pre>  Local starter pid 30992 for job 3.0 exited with status 1\n  ERROR: Local Starter exited with unknown value 1!\n</pre>\n\n<p><em>and immediately re-runs the job</em>.   The problem loops, eventually consuming all 32000ish possible subdirectories.  No further local universe jobs can run; all will fail trying to create the subdirectory.  Condor will never clean up these directories.\n\n</p><p>This process also leaks disposable run accounts created on Windows.  If the computer also run the startd, the next time the startd starts up, the run accounts will be deleted (<em>possibly while still in use by the local universe!</em>).  Otherwise the run accounts are never deleted.\n\n</p><p>Problem 1: In this case the job should be put on hold, not left in idle.\n</p><ul>\n<li>Cause: The schedd.cpp Scheduler::jobExitCode isn't prepared to handle \"1\" as a failure from the starter, and just tosses the job back into idle.\n</li><li>Fix: In schedd.cpp Scheduler::jobExitCode's default case,  if(exit_code==1 &amp;&amp; IsLocalUniverse(srec)), then put the job on hold.\n<ul>\n<li>Problems: The <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=HoldReason\" title=\"Hold Reason\">HoldReason</a></span> is non-specific and less helpful.  Jobs may be put on hold not because the job has a problem, but because the condor_starter has an unrelated problem .\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Better Fix: Have the starter send a message with the problem to the schedd so that the job can be put on hold with a useful reason.  I haven't yet dug into what would be involved.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Problem 1a: The fix for problem 1 leaves the job with an unhelpful hold reason.\n</p><ul>\n<li>Fix: TODO  Look to how jobs get put on hold when the starter explodes for the same reason on a vanilla job.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Problem 2: Leaked directory.  (This user <em>also</em> had a pretty aggressive <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=PeriodicRelease\" title=\"Periodic Release\">PeriodicRelease</a></span>, so fixing problem 1 isn't enough.)\n</p><ul>\n<li>Cause: starter normally cleans up after itself, but terminated abnormally.  When running under a startd, the startd has a copy of the cleanup code and will manage it.\n</li><li>Fix: Move CStarter::removeTempExecuteDir's implementation into a shared location, probably condor_c++_util for lack of a better location.  Call it from the schedd in TODO???\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Problem 3: The directory (and Windows disposable user) cleanup code is duplicated between the startds cleanup_execute_dir() and the starters CStarter::removeTempExecuteDir. As duplicates, they may drift apart.\n</p><ul>\n<li>Fix: Having moved CStarter::removeTempExecuteDir's implementation into a shared location, have cleanup_execute_dir call it instead of reimplementing it.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Problem 4: The schedd doesn't clean up leaked local universe execute directories on startup.  The startd does.\n</p><ul>\n<li>Fix: Move cleanup_execute_dirs out of the startd and into a shared location (probably condor_c++_util again).  Call cleanup_execute_dirs in schedd.cpp:7568 Scheduler::initLocalStarterDir.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Current plan plan:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Investigate and propose fix plan only.\n<ul>\n<li>Identify other possible problems, leaks, etc stemming from same core problem (starter self manages, but may EXCEPT or otherwise exit uncleanly)\n</li><li>As part of plan: schedd should probably clean up on unexpected starter exit, schedd should probably clean up rogue (all?) on startup.\n</li><li>Email fix plan to Miron, Todd, Alain.\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"subsection\"></span></p><h3>Alternate Fix</h3>\n\n<p>As an alternate solution, we could run/contact a startd and run the starters under the startd.  This may necessitate running shadows as well.\n\n</p><p>The pieces may already be in place.  A schedd can contact and use a local startd without needing a negotiation cycle.  A startd can dynamically repartition itself into \"more\" slots.\n\n</p><p>Advantages:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Existing, known good, startd cleanup code works.\n</li><li>Some existing redunant policy evaluation duplicated between the schedd (for local universe) and the startd can potentially be eliminated, simplifying code.\n</li><li>More work will be moved out of the schedd into the startd/shadows, increasing parallelism and reducing load on the typically loaded schedd.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Disadvantages:\n</p><ul>\n<li>More processes with attendant FD, memory, and processor consumption.\n</li><li>Increased configuration complexity.  If we reuse the existing startd, do we need to craft a policy to handle a mix of vanilla and local jobs?  Do we run two, in which case we need multiple sets of configuration?\n</li><li>This may create the public impression that Condor is always heavyweight, and not appropriate for the sorts of jobs that the local universe exists for.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"subsection\"></span></p><h3>Test case </h3>\n\n<p>Submit file:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">OnExitRemove = false\nExecutable = /bin/date\nLog = eraseme.log\nUniverse = local\nNotification = never\nDeferralTime = (CurrentTime + 30)\nDeferralWindow = 99999999\nDeferralPrepTime = 1\nqueue\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Immediately after submitting it, \"chmod u-w eraseme.log\".
