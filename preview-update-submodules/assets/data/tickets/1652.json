{"id": 1652, "title": "Ticket #1652: Schedd controls who sends alives", "description": "<blockquote>\nSTARTD_SENDS_ALIVES is an error-prone knob, especially when flocking. If the submit and execute machines don't have it set the same, then you can end up in a situation where neither daemon is sending keep-alives, and all jobs die an early death. There should be one place where the decision of who sends the keep-alives for a given claim is made. The schedd makes the most sense. At the start of the claim, the schedd should inform the startd who is responsible for sending keep-alives. The default should be for the startd to send them. And both daemons should be backwards-compatible with older versions.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Sep-15 00:01:07 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed changes to master for 7.5.4.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Sep-15 00:00</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/c6e36ef12e2d7c07f14a0635f2793b12f3d3d767\">[18979]</a></span>: Schedd controls who sends keep-alives. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1652\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1652'); return false;\" title=\"Schedd controls who sends alives\">#1652</a></span> STARTD_SENDS_ALIVES is an error-prone knob, especially when flocking.
