This repository contains their personal code corresponding to analyses that haven't been published -- not a great candidate for <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DockerHub\" title=\"Docker Hub\">DockerHub</a></span>.\n\n<p>They do, however, have access to a token that allows them to access the private repository.  They'd like to be able to give this token to HTCondor and have it used when the Docker image is downloaded.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Apr-04 04:25", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Apr-04 04:25", "fixed_version": "2019-Apr-04 04:25", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cern", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelman@morgridge.org", "due_date": ""}
