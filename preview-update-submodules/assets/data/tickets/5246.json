{"id": 5246, "title": "Ticket #5246: Increase monitorability of vanilla universe checkpointing.", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe should make vanilla-universe checkpointing more visible.  First, we should fiddle the job ad appropriately when we enter checkpoint transfer, and when we exit.  (At a lower priority, if we're using signal-based VU checkpointing, we can even note when checkpointing is occurring.)\n\n<p>This may have some commonality with <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4969\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4969'); return false;\" title=\"Correctly report checkpointing status from vanilla universe.\">#4969</a></span>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Apr-27 15:03:04 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nIn particular, it could be useful to know a number of different durations both for monitoring job health (is this job checkpointing properly?  is it overloading the checkpoint servers?) and for policy expressions (if it took twenty minutes to checkpoint last time, and I finished that checkpoint five minutes ago, maybe I should just hard-kill the job and not do file-transfer, since that would minimize badput*).\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>duration of last checkpoint (from signal to process termination)\n</li><li>duration of last \"timestep\" (from process (re)start to process restart via self-checkpointing)\n</li><li>duration of last checkpoint filetransfer (e.g. \"system\" checkpoint duration)\n</li><li>duration between sending the last checkpoint signal and the process exiting\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>We should also consider adding a mechanism by which the job can signal the starter than it's starting a checkpoint, both in response to a periodic checkpoint (I received the signal and have reached the end of a timestep) and when starting a self-checkpoint.\n\n</p><p>These values should be either directly present in or readily derivable from the job ad.\n\n</p><p>* - Not sure if we can turn of file transfer with job and/or startd policy expressions.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "experimental", "last_change": "2016-Apr-27 15:03", "status": "defer", "created": "2015-Aug-28 21:42", "fixed_version": "2015-Aug-28 21:42", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#4968", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
