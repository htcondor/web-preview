Especially since the user can probably run /path/to/test/exe and have it run as their shell covers for them.  We should provide a more helpful message:\n\n</p><p>Possibilities:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Add \"If your job is a shell script, ensure the correct interpreter is specified on the #! line of your program.\"\n</li><li>As above, but try to be clever and sniff that it's not a binary.
