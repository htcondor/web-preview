{"id": 1495, "title": "Ticket #1495: Condor on Windows unable to run jobs in 64-bit mode", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe currently provide the Windows Condor as a 32-bit application. If run on a 64-bit Windows environment, Condor will be executed via the Windows-32-on-Windows-64 (WOW64) subsystem.\n\n<p>One of the advantages of 64-bit applications over 32-bit applications on Windows is that they are able to use more than 4GB of RAM. However, it seems if we spawn a Condor job, the executable is always run in 32-bit mode and can therefore not benefit from the 64-bit OS and suffers from the 4GB memory limit.\n\n</p><p>Condor should be able to run a job in 64-bit mode - if supported by the running Windows. All information collected so far indicates that it is possible to fork off a 64-bit process from a 32-bit program.\n\n</p><p>Relevant read:\n\n</p><p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/509989/how-to-allow-32-bit-apps-on-64-bit-windows-to-execute-64-bit-apps-provided-in-win\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/509989/how-to-allow-32-bit-apps-on-64-bit-windows-to-execute-64-bit-apps-provided-in-win</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 12:25", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Jul-08 14:32", "fixed_version": "2010-Jul-08 14:32", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "cweiss", "rust": "a20747", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "cweiss@cs.wisc.edu tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
