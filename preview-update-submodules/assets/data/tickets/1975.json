{"id": 1975, "title": "Ticket #1975: Have schedd use the same Email object as the shadow", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe schedd implements its own functionality for emailing the user when a job completes (aka <code>schedd.cpp NotifyUser()</code>). It should use the spiffy email object in the util lib (<code>utils/email_cpp.cpp</code>), just like the shadow does. This will eliminate unexpected differences in how user email notification works between different universes, and will allow us to maintain behavior of how/when email is sent in just one place.\n\n<p>Possible STUDENTTASK</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-May-09 10:30:41 by slauson:</em> <br/>\n\nResolving ticket as this work is under review in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1976\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1976'); return false;\" title=\"Send email if job notification is set to Error and job goes on hold\">#1976</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-May-03 11:21", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Mar-17 08:27", "fixed_version": "2011-Mar-17 08:27", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "slauson", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
