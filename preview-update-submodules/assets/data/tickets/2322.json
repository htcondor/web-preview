{"id": 2322, "title": "Ticket #2322: Improve bad hostname handling in the gridmanager", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe gridmanager needs to handle bad hostnames better. If a user mistypes the hostname in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GridResource\" title=\"Grid Resource\">GridResource</a></span> attribute, the gridmanager will usually mark the resource as down and wait (potentially forever) for it to become reachable (which it never will). The gridmanager could do some basic sanity checks on the hostname and put the job on hold an informative message if the name doesn't resolve.\n\n<p>A common variant of this problem is a gram jobmanager that returns a non-fully qualified hostname in its contact URL. Currently, the gridmanager will repeatedly try and fail to contact the jobmanager, attempting to restart the jobmanager in between tries. As above, the gridmanager should try resolve the hostname and put the job on hold if that fails.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jan-30 14:28", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Jul-19 14:30", "fixed_version": "2011-Jul-19 14:30", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
