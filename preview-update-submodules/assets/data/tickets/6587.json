{"id": 6587, "title": "Ticket #6587: proxy delegation without file transfer", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf one submits a job in the vanilla universe that does not use the file transfer mechanism (e.g. jobs on a filesystem mounted on execute nodes), the behavior of <code>use_x509userproxy</code> is not what you might expect. Rather than delegating the proxy to the worker node, the proxy-related variables retain the value they had on the submit node.\n\n<p>Therefore, this scheme only works if one also sets <code>x509userproxy</code> to a location on a filesystem shared between the submit and execute nodes (and create a proxy there). This isn't proxy \"delegation\" per se, just a shared file.\n\n</p><p>LIGO would be able to make fairly immediate use of proper proxy delegation in the absence of file transfer mechanisms to access X509-protected data on CVMFS. We consider this one step along the way toward obviating the shared filesystem dependency in many of our workflows.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Feb-28 14:44:29 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nI marked v0806 as the \"broken\" version -- presuambly v1 is literally accurate --  but I presume this to be an 8.7 series feature change.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Apr-26 10:20:57 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nSince Zach is now on this ticket, I'll include a link to our thread on htcondor-users \"Submitting and refreshing X509_USER_PROXY\"...\n\n<p><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/htcondor-users/2018-April/msg00161.shtml\">https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/htcondor-users/2018-April/msg00161.shtml</a>\n\n</p><p>The \"easiest\" thing from the user / support perspective is to make use of the impersonation proxy created at login in a manner that predictably survives reboot or logout. And can probably be updated by the user predictably / easily. Whether that ease of support / use is worth it in a larger sense is up for debate, but I appreciate your giving it some thought.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Apr-26 10:24:33 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nWorth adding also that you should place this in the larger context of <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SciTokens\" title=\"Sci Tokens\">SciTokens</a></span>. The data we are accessing over CVMFS that is X509-protected will likely be SciToken-accessed in the future. There will probably be overlap in time for the two technologies, but that transition should feel seamless for our users.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Apr-26 10:56:15 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nWe've talked about a couple different ways to implement this.\n\n<p>One way is to push the proxy through the existing file transfer mechanism. When we're evaluating <code>x509userproxy</code> and <code>use_x509userproxy</code>, we also check if we're using file transfer. If we're not, then we bump the proxy onto the file transfer list, and cedar will handle the delegation. This could have some side effects though with filename remaps and working directories which I don't fully understand.\n\n</p><p>Another option is to implement a new RPC between the shadow and starter explicitly for proxy delegation. This involves more new code. It also means implementing the delegation code in a second place, which I don't love. But overall sounds like a cleaner solution.\n\n</p><p>Thoughts?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-May-02 10:21:29 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nI assume you're asking a developer. :)\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-May-02 15:34:13 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nYes I was, just wanted to keep our dev chatter on the public record :) We talked about it and we're moving forward with the RPC approach.
