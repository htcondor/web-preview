I was hoping that the problem was that the Solaris 10 VM was running on a VMWare 1.0 vhost, but the problem is persiting on a brand-shiny new ESXi vhost.\n\n<p>I'm currently doing a hand build &amp; test to hopefully figure out what's wrong.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nCondor doesn't handle the hostname not being an FQDN well at all.
