{"id": 5932, "title": "Ticket #5932: Inefficient JobRouter location routines", "description": "<blockquote>\nSeveral OSG sites (and CERN) have had issues with how the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobRouter\" title=\"Job Router\">JobRouter</a></span> locates the local batch system schedd.\n\n<p>Right now, we specify a pool / schedd name.  That means the HTCondor-CE schedd must contact the collector &amp; wait for a response to find the batch system schedd on this host.  At CERN, we noticed this taking a lot of time and slowing things down: various other OSG sites have had issues with authentication with the collector.  It's a devilishly difficult issue to track down.\n\n</p><p>This is all overkill: the batch system schedd's spool directory <strong>must</strong> be local for job tracking, so the batch system schedd ad should also be a local file.\n\n</p><p>The <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=JobRouter\" title=\"Job Router\">JobRouter</a></span> should be able to take a filesystem location for a schedd ad in order to find the batch system schedd.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-Sep-29 14:56", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Sep-29 13:00", "fixed_version": "2016-Sep-29 13:00", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu iain.steers@cern.ch", "due_date": ""}
