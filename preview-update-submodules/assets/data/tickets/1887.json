{"id": 1887, "title": "Ticket #1887: We should check the executable bit", "description": "<blockquote>\nAs a noob, one of the most frustrating things about Condor is submitting a job, only to have to check the log to see that there is some problem with the executable.  The case I am thinking about mostly is where one writes a shell script with a text editor and forgets to turn the executable bit on.  It should be easy for condor_submit to check the executable bit of an \"executable\" and see that it is off, and then warn the user that their job is not going to run.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jan-30 07:38:38 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nIt would be even better if a check happened in the starter so the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=HoldReason\" title=\"Hold Reason\">HoldReason</a></span> could be augmented to state why exec failed.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-31 15:26:34 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nI think this patch breaks java universe, as the .class file is listed as the executable, but doesn't need the executable bit set.
