If <code>DoPumpWork</code> were before the signal handlers, then there would not be this delay.   Alternatively, if we forced the select timer to be 0 when the signal table is set, this would also avoid the delay.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Mar-20 12:15:44 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>This looks good.  There should be no further implications of moving the (Windows-specific) work pump in front of the signal handling, because Windows doesn't actually have signals.  (It may be possible for the DC_RAISESIGNAL to be handled during normal socket-handling, depending on the security settings, if the work pump handles security but the command packet is delayed, but that's fine: select() will exit when the command packet arrives and the signal will be handled after pumping work on the next go-around.)\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Mar-20 12:16:52 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThis might be worth mentioning in the version history (and maybe to fill out a release announcement).</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6735\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6735'); return false;\" title=\"Delay between execution of jobs on Windows with shared_port enabled\">#6735</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nDelay between execution of jobs on Windows with shared_port enabled</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Apr-08 16:41</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/3918a080b52ee07195e723defe099a0d9d47cb23\">[56521]</a></span>: Version history for several issues with Windows restart, reconfig and shutdown. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6952\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6952'); return false;\" title=\"shared port + procd on Windows causes the master to fail to restart\">#6952</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6957\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6957'); return false;\" title='Schedd on Windows restarts with \"fd_set is full\" message'>#6957</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6960\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6960'); return false;\" title=\"shared port on Windows can make damons slow to notice signals\">#6960</a></span>  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Mar-20 10:58</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/261a8d6f37e08159f05d5092ff07cb5b567e58d5\">[56393]</a></span>: Fix for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6960\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6960'); return false;\" title=\"shared port on Windows can make damons slow to notice signals\">#6960</a></span>. shared port on Windows can make daemons slow to notice signals ===VersionHistory:Pending===  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-Apr-08 16:44", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-Mar-19 16:02", "fixed_version": "2019-Mar-19 16:02", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "johnkn", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
