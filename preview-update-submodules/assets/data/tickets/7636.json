It would be good if condor could grab the for example, the environment (/proc/PID/environ) of the first child of the process spawned by the starter, rather than the starter itself for this use-case.\n\n</p><p></p><pre>     # Work around missing PTY\n     script /dev/null\n     # Re-set home directory (of course, this needs to be adapted):\n     export HOME=/jwd\n     # Re-source /etc/profile:\n     source /etc/profile\n     # Fixup TERM\n     export TERM=linux\n     # And here's the magic trick for CUDA:\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/.singularity.d/libs/</pre>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-May-08 08:51", "status": "new", "created": "2020-May-08 07:32", "fixed_version": "2020-May-08 07:32", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "khurtado", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
