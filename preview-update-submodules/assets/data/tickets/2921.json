{"id": 2921, "title": "Ticket #2921: regression - incorrect recovery in dagman", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen recovery occurs for jobs between termination and post script termination such as:\n\n<p>ULOG_JOB_TERMINATED\n&lt;recovery&gt;\nULOG_POST_SCRIPT_TERMINATED\n\n</p><p>the state information isn't handled correctly in recovery. Although the jobs have post scripts and a ULOG_JOB_TERMINATED event, the jobs do not transition to running the post script. The result is you see the following in the dagman out file and a rescue is dumped:\n\n</p><p> 02/28/12 09:14:32 ERROR: DAG finished but not all nodes are complete -- checking\n for a cycle...\n02/28/12 09:14:32 ...

I tested things with the 7.7.2 master, and that works okay, so it's definitely something in this branch.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-04 09:14:47 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nLook at <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/7ce3a85c756e8317bdb440ae3269faa7f12fe44e\">[27074]</a></span> for the fix.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-04 12:03:03 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nDo we need to cherry-pick that over to 7.6?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-04 12:05:20 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- I guess cherry-picking things over might be hard since the fix is part of a new feature in the 7.7 series.  One question is, how long has this bug existed?  If it has existed for a long time, especially, maybe we should just document it in 7.6 and not fix it, especially since 7.8 will be coming out fairly soon.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-04 12:06:41 by jrt:</em> <br/>\n\nIt was a regression from 7.6.0 to 7.6.4\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-04 12:08:34 by jrt:</em> <br/>\n\nActually those versions are probably not entirely correct.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-04 12:11:35 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nRe yim with Matt:  one way to fix this might be to cherry-pick over the whole implementation of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2057\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2057'); return false;\" title=\"Always run POST script, even if PRE script fails\">#2057</a></span> -- the main issue with that is that it would be introducing a new feature (at least somewhat) to the stable series.  If we \"manually\" fix it in 7.6, that will take more work, and also probably cause a merge conflict.\n\n<p>Nathan -- can you add a test for this?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Apr-04 16:04:33 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nThere is a test on master.  Furthermore, the current head of 7.6 does not show this behavior for me on my desktop.
