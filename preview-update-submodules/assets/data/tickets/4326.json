{"id": 4326, "title": "Ticket #4326: Clean up condor-web (official web pages)", "description": "<blockquote>\nHow to edit htcondor-web page is documented at <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/developers/web.html\">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/developers/web.html</a>\n\n<p>Tasks:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>Move htcondor-web from CVS to Git.  Preserve history.  This may mean going CVS to SVN to Git.  Be sure to update <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/developers/web.html\">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/developers/web.html</a>  In the process, ensure that the final name is \"htcondor-web\", not \"condor-web\".  Currently you check it out from CVS as htcondor-web, but you will end up with a directory called condor-web.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Mount htcondor-web/developers to htcondor-web/htcondor/developers.  Currently the live web site is almost entirely based out of htcondor-web/htcondor/; almost nothing in the top level is served.  This eliminates an exceptional case.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Clean out everything in htcondor-web expect htcondor-web/htcondor. Currently the live web site is almost entirely based out of htcondor-web/htcondor/; almost nothing in the top level is served.  This almost but not entirely dead directory is confusing, leading to people thinking they're updating the site when they're not. This will be tricky, so go slowly and check often.  Some files may need to move into the htcondor-web/htcondor heirarchy.  A spider to crawl the site looking for dead links may be helpful.\n<ol>\n<li>Once done, move everything inside htcondor-web/htcondor up one directory, adjusting the web site to match. (Symlinks may be helpful during the transition.)  This will utterly eliminate some deadweight.</li></ol>\n</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2014-Apr-21 14:27", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Apr-21 14:27", "fixed_version": "2014-Apr-21 14:27", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
