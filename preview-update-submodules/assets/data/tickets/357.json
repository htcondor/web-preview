{"id": 357, "title": "Ticket #357: WS-GRAM and RFT on different machines for GT4 grid jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn the gt4 grid-type, a WS-GRAM service can be configured to use an RFT service in a different container. As a delegated credential can only be accessed from within the same container, this setup requires the client to delegate the credential to two different Delegation services, one in GRAM's container and one in RFT's container. The client can query the WS GRAM service for the RFT service it uses. globusrun-ws handles this split case, while Condor-G does not. The Condor-G job will fail due to RFT being unable to retrieve the credential.\n\n<p>This setup (GRAM and RFT in different containers) appears to be rarely used in the wild.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Mar-21 14:47:58 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nWe've dropped support for GT4 as of Condor 7.7.5. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2782\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2782'); return false;\" title=\"Remove GT4 GRAM support from grid universe\">#2782</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Mar-21 14:47", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Mar-31 14:40", "fixed_version": "2009-Mar-31 14:40", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
