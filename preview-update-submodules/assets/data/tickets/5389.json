We need one.  If we implement <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5388\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5388'); return false;\" title=\"HTCondor View: URL history for internal changes\">#5388</a></span> (URL history for internal changes), the answer is \"use your browser's back button.\"  However, either way it would be nice to have direct way to say \"return to all.\"\n\n<p>A \"TOTAL\" line the in table would solve the problem.  The selection logic would need to know about it, and we might want special trickery to keep it sorted at the top.\n\n</p><p>A simpler solution would be to add a \"Reset\" button.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Nov-30 17:29:15 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nImplemented by adding an additional table that drops the select_tuple fields and sums the remainder, effectively creating a TOTAL line. You can click on it to go back to the main view.\n\n<p>However, there is no label indicating that it's the TOTAL, and it really could use one to be more clear. Also, not obvious that you could click it, although this was basically how <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=CondorView\" title=\"Condor View\">CondorView</a></span> solved the problem.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Dec-01 13:49:30 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nAdded \"TOTAL\" label to the summary table.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Dec-01 13:56:00 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nMatching column widths is Hard; requires either poking deep into Google's code, which seems fragile.\n\n<p>Better solution would be roll my own table implementation, in which case I no longer need to match column widths; I can just special case the TOTAL row in the first place.\n\n</p><p>Calling this done for now.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Dec-01 13:48</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/264680aecc49eba3ebe96f596a5a993252bf8492\">[47951]</a></span>: Add \"TOTAL\" label to total table. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5389\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5389'); return false;\" title='HTCondor View: how to return to \"main\" view of linked graph?'>#5389</a></span>  (By Alan De Smet )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Nov-30 17:27</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/b01390c4d58ef00a8b4944e146bd0bbc65d60dd0\">[47950]</a></span>: Add summary table; click to reset graph. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5389\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5389'); return false;\" title='HTCondor View: how to return to \"main\" view of linked graph?'>#5389</a></span>  (By Alan De Smet )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Dec-01 13:56", "status": "resolved", "created": "2015-Nov-11 14:33", "fixed_version": "2015-Nov-11 14:33", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#5351", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
