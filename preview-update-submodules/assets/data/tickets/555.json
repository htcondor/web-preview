I looked at the glibc code itself, and %z isn't in the cases of the switch statement.\n\n</p><p>Since the RHEL3 full port of Condor uses that exact revision of glibc, any program condor_compiled on a RHEL3 port of Condor using strptime() and the %z format option is doomed to fail. I have in fact reproduced this problem outside of condor_compile all together, removing Condor from the equation (to be specific, on a real RHEL3 machine running the user's test case).\n\n</p><p>It appears in my testing that the RHEL5 full port of Condor doesn't suffer from this problem and the glibc on that machine implements %z.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Sep-30 15:45:58 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nMy advice, mentioned in the ticket, is to use the POSIX format specifiers instead of the GNU extensions and/or upgrade to the RHEL5 full port of Condor.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 08:36", "status": "defer", "created": "2009-Jun-11 14:23", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-11 14:23", "broken_version": "v070200", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Std", "assigned_to": "psilord", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "a19218", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
