{"id": 5972, "title": "Ticket #5972: Starter crash during exit()", "description": "<blockquote>\nA post to the htcondor-users list reports a seg-faulting starter. The problem appears to be due to an attempt to send a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> over a socket inside a global destructor, after the global destructors for some internal <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> data structures have already been called.\n\n<p>I can reproduce the crash on linux by having the shadow EXCEPT() immediately after creating its child process for moving the input sandbox. The crash doesn't happen consistently, as there's a race between the starter reaping its child process (and calling EXCEPT() due to the failed transfer) and the starter receiving a SIGTERM from the startd.\n\n</p><p>Here is the sequence of events in the starter:\n</p><ul>\n<li>File transfer of the input sandbox is started (child process created)\n</li><li>Network connections to the shadow are closed on the remote side\n</li><li>SIGTERM received, starter begins a graceful shutdown\n</li><li>With no jobs running, starter calls DC_Exit(), which deletes <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DaemonCore\" title=\"Daemon Core\">DaemonCore</a></span> and then calls exit()\n</li><li>Destructor for classad::specialAttrNames is called\n</li><li>Destructor for CStarter object is called, which causes the following events\n<ul>\n<li>Destructor for JICShadow is called\n</li><li>Destructor for <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=FileTransfer\" title=\"File Transfer\">FileTransfer</a></span> is called, which tries to cancel the active transfer\n</li><li>FileTransfer::abortActiveTransfer() ASSERT()s because daemonCore is NULL\n</li><li>The starter's custom exception cleanup function tries to write a log entry and send a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> message to the shadow\n</li><li>Sending the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> message seg-faults because it tries to evaluate <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=TargetType\" title=\"Target Type\">TargetType</a></span>, which accesses classad::specialAttrNames, which is already deleted.\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>A simple fix for this problem would be for the starter to disable its custom exception cleanup routine (set _EXCEPT_Cleanup to NULL) before calling DC_Exit(). A better fix would be do most of the tear-down of CStarter and its member objects before calling DC_Exit(), probably by making the CStarter object not be a global object, but one that's deleted before DC_Exit().</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Oct-18 16:16:33 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nSetting _EXCEPT_Cleanup to NULL in CStarter::StarterExit() does prevent this crash. But we're still blundering through a minefield of potential crashes. The <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=FileTransfer\" title=\"File Transfer\">FileTransfer</a></span> destructor called under exit() still causes an EXCEPT() due to daemonCore being NULL. There are surely other pitfalls waiting for us.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Oct-18 16:39:24 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe original post to htcondor-users was made on October 17, 2016, by Antontio Dorta &lt;adorta@iac.es&gt; with the subject line <code>condor_starter... kernel: NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU stuck for...</code>.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Oct-21 10:09:11 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI initially committed this fix to the master branch, when I had intended it to go into the 8.4 stable series.
