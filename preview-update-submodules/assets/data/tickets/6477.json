The metrics configuration defines a metric type for each named resource: SUM:GPUs, PEAK:GPUsMemory.  The monitor writes attributes named Uptime&lt;Resource&gt;Seconds or Uptime&lt;Resource&gt;PeakUsage, respectively; this could change in the future, but makes the current implementation easier (because the aggregation functions don't have to change the name of the attribute).\n\n</p><p>The startd generates the job-specific &lt;Resource&gt;Usage automatically.

This got me worried about more-subtle problems that might be hiding in the 5/6 to 7/6 range of allowed values, so I took a closer look to see if we could just allow 5/6, 6/6, and 7/6.*  The answer is no, because the startd presently computes usage as of when it writes the update ad (based on the total usage computed from the previous sample), which means we're occasionally too high because we're not dividing by the full length of the job.\n\n</p><p>The obvious solution is for the startd to compute the usage as of the last sample time, which is more accurate anyway, especially since -- as noted above -- we're not waiting around for the last sample interval anyway.  This still leaves some imprecision stemming from the job not starting at a sample boundary.  However, if we ignore the first (incomplete) interval, we can get an accurate usage number even though the usage we're accumulating is up to two intervals under-counted (because we're not dividing the accumulated value by the duration of those intervals).\n\n</p><p>This should (a) enable the use of exact values in the test and (b) improve the accuracy of the reported usage number in real operation.\n\n</p><p>Additionally, if using a continuous cron job that, like the GPU monitor, samples far more frequently than it reports, the continuous cron job could report a new sample when it detects increased usage, rather than waiting for its whole sampling period; this would cause the startd to include more of the job's usage in its accumulator.  Likewise, an additional sample could be published at the end of GPU usage to include that (assuming the job's spin-down period was long less than the faster sampling rate of the monitor).  We're leaving those as ideas in case it turns out people really do care about the total accumulated values.\n\n</p><p>* That is, the test run is six sampling intervals long.  Ideally, we'd see six samples' worth of usage, but of course we could miss an interval's worth of sampling at the end of the job (since we don't wait for the next sample before deactivating the claim).  It turns out we could also have an extra interval's worth because the startd measures from when it spawns the starter (which may be right before a sample) to some time just before the job ends (which may be right after a sample, if the starter took long enough to spawn the job and/or other race conditions occur).\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Jan-25 19:04:21 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nThis ticket has gotten large enough, and I believe I've done everything that needs to be done for an 8.7.7 release, except for verify the final packaging works.
