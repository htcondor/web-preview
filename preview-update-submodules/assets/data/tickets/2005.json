{"id": 2005, "title": "Ticket #2005: Review/update condor_status/condor_q default reports", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe report formats from condor_status and condor_q are pretty old, frequently based on very old assumptions about the largest values that might be displayed.  As modern systems get more powerful, the assumptions are increasingly violated and the resulting reports get jaggy and ugly.  All of the reports should be review (possible STUDENTTASK).  Specific items:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>\"condor_status\" the Mem column can handle 4 digits. When you get machines with &gt; 9.9GB of RAM, it looks pretty bad.  Proposal: In the report show in GB?\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">monitor_17986@d6co LINUX      X86_64 Owner     Idle     2.010  1201  0+00:37:51\nglidein_12431@d6co LINUX      X86_64 Claimed   Busy     0.000  12016  0+00:05:42\nmonitor_12431@d6co LINUX      X86_64 Owner     Idle     0.000  1201  0+00:37:51\nglidein_21415@d6co LINUX      X86_64 Claimed   Busy     0.000  12016  0+00:04:20\nmonitor_21415@d6co LINUX      X86_64 Owner     Idle     0.000  1201  0+00:35:04\nglidein_3373@d6cop LINUX      X86_64 Claimed   Busy     6.210  12016  0+00:04:36\n</pre></div>\n\n</li><li>\"condor_q\" busy pools can easily exceed the 9999.9 jobs before the ID column starts widening.
