{"id": 5878, "title": "Ticket #5878: Really remove STARTD_CRON_NAME and SCHEDD_CRON_NAME", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe manual says, \"These variables will be honored through HTCondor versions 7.6, and support will be removed in HTCondor version 7.7. They are no longer documented as to their usage.\"\n\n<p>But these still exist in the code in 8.5.6, and they still do <strong>something</strong> -- they generate a warning, but then SetName() gets called with the value of the config knob.  So I don't know what \"no longer supported\" means.  Does it mean \"deprecated\", because Karen didn't like that term?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-Aug-30 13:17", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Aug-30 13:17", "fixed_version": "2016-Aug-30 13:17", "broken_version": "v080506", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
