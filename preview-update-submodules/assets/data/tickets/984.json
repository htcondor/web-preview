{"id": 984, "title": "Ticket #984: gt2_gahp has potential buffer overflow", "description": "<blockquote>\n<a class=\"file\" href=\"rlog?f=src/gt2_gahp/gahp_server.c\">/src/gt2_gahp/gahp_server.c</a> gahp_printf does a vsprintf into a 10000 byte array.  It is conceivable that someone could call gahp_printf with more than 10000 of expected output.  We don't believe this can happen in the code as it exists today, but Just In Case we should protect against it.  This should be fixed to use vsnprintf, and to exit with an error if we didn't have enough space.\n\n<p>Note: As best we know, it's not possible for gahp_printf to actually be called in this way.  This should be completely invisible to end users.  Thus, no version history entry.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Nov-19 15:05</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/9be3a7cb5d49e358e2d620fa55ac3a115f48cf92\">[16387]</a></span>: Add defensive measures to gahp_printf to eliminate risk of buffer overrun.
