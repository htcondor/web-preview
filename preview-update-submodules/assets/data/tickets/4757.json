The jobs just stay idle; there's nothing in the job user log or even the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SchedLog\" title=\"Sched Log\">SchedLog</a></span> that indicates that you hit this limit, and, of course, you can't use condor_q -analyze to figure out what's going on.\n\n</p><p>I can see a number of possible things to do (kind of in order of increasing work):\n</p><ol>\n<li>Print something in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SchedLog\" title=\"Sched Log\">SchedLog</a></span> when jobs don't start because of this limit.\n</li><li>Put this information in some event in the job's user log, if it has one.\n</li><li>Print this information when you do condor_q -analyze on a scheduler or local universe job.\n</li><li>Print a warning when you submit a scheduler or local universe job, and the schedd has hit (or is close to) one of these limits.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>One other bizarre symptom:  this apparently causes newly-submitted scheduler universe jobs, at least, to not appear at all in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SchedLog\" title=\"Sched Log\">SchedLog</a></span>.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Dec-05 16:10", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Dec-05 16:10", "fixed_version": "2014-Dec-05 16:10", "broken_version": "v080205", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
