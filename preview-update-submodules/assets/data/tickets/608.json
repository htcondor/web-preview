{"id": 608, "title": "Ticket #608: If VMware is installed, make it's services dependencies of Condor", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt seems that sometimes the Condor service starts before the VMware service have, and if VM Universe support is enabled, this will cause the vm-gaph to fail.  Thus, if we detect, at install time, that VMware is installed, we should then make Condor explicitly dependent on the VMware services.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jun-30 06:42:30 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is not only a problem on Windows, and it is the same problem we had with the credd.
