{"id": 7497, "title": "Ticket #7497: Custom machine resource docs should clearly state restrictions on name", "description": "<blockquote>\nSince 8.9.4, per <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=7172\">https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=7172</a>, there are two restrictions on custom machine resource names: they must not start with an underscore, and they must be at least 2 characters long.\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, this is not documented anywhere except in the version history.
