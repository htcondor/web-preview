{"id": 4067, "title": "Ticket #4067: Debian packaging installs files owned by uid 1011", "description": "<blockquote>\n(From LIGO:)\n\n<p>The package installs /etc/init.d/condor, /etc/condor (and its contents), and /usr/bin/condor.* with ownership of uid/gid of 1011. That doesn't map to condor:condor on my system and the package management doesn't enforce that mapping - it might successfully enforce the mapping if the condor:condor user/group doesn't exist before the package is installed and uid/gid 1011:1011 is unclaimed. On a system where 1011:1011 Condor installs A-OK if 1011:1011 happens to be some random user.\n\n</p><p>I also don't see why those directories/files need to be writable by condor/condor. Readable, sure. I just have CFEngine chown everything Condor installs to root:root and ensure global readability.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nAlso happening at CAE. 8.0.5 has 1003 for the uid/gid.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Jan-17 14:02:32 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nThis happened between the 7.6.x and 7.7.x series.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Sep-22 15:41:01 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nTim:\n\n<p>You believe this is resolved - if so, close the ticket and I will take actions to confirm when 8.2.10 is released.\n\n</p><p>Thanks.\n\n</p><p>Tom\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Sep-23 10:18:06 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nThis was fixed by updated release processes as of HTCondor 8.2.8</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2019-Oct-08 09:57", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Nov-14 11:56", "fixed_version": "2013-Nov-14 11:56", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tpdownes@gravity.phys.uwm.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
