{"id": 3806, "title": "Ticket #3806: condor-admin silently dropping email", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom email:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>&gt; &gt; I sent this last week and never got an auto-ack from RUST\u2026 any idea why?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Peter\n&gt;\n&gt; No idea.  The CS Department here has been having some network issues,\n&gt; but I'd imagine your mail spool would have simple queued and resent the\n&gt; message later. I just sent a couple test messages to condor-admin and it\n&gt; seemed to be working.  Zach, could you please investigate the RUST logs\n&gt; from July 3rd and see if you observe anything?\n&gt;\n&gt; Todd\n\nI see Peter's mail in the RUST logs, but for whatever reason no ticket was\ncreated as a result.  I can't find any errors, nor was anything sent to\ncondor-system complaining about a malformed RUST, which is what sometimes\nhappens.\n\nSo, mail delivery worked.  RUST sucked, and as far as I can tell it did so\nsilently. :(\n\n\nCheers,\n-zach\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The only clue I can offer is that I attached some relevant logs, so the email was somewhat large (~3.5MB).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nDup ticket (unknowingly created despite server error at submit time).</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2013-Jul-24 11:31", "status": "defer", "created": "2013-Jul-24 11:19", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-24 11:19", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "pfc", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pfcouvar@syr.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
