{"id": 3451, "title": "Ticket #3451: file transfer from win to linux (or reverse) directory support broken", "description": "<blockquote>\nper a report from HTCondor-users:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">I have a job that creates a directory containing output files. So after\nthe job runs on the execute machine I have\n\ndir1\n    file1\n    file2\n    file3\n\nIn the job description file I have\ntransfer_output_files = dir1\n\nWhen I submit the job from a linux host but the job executes on a\nwindows host when the files are copied back to the submit host instead\nof a directory containing the output files I get an empty directory and\nthen a bunch of files whose names are the directory name and file name\njoined by a backslash.\n\nbash-4.1$ls\ndir1  dir1\\file1  dir1\\file2  dir1\\file3\nbash-4.1$\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>obviously the DIR_DELIM_CHAR is not being correctly translated.\n\n</p><p>on linux, no code changes are necessary.  the following two proposed change applies to windows only:\n</p><ul>\n<li>the filename sent across the wire has all backslashes converted to forward slashes\n</li><li>upon receiving any filename, all forward slashes are converted to backslashes.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>as a result of the above:\n</p><ul>\n<li>when sending from linux to linux no changes are made to the slashes\n</li><li>when sending from windows to linux, you'll end up with all slashes converted to forward slashes.\n</li><li>when sending from windows to windows you'll end up with all slashes converted to backward slashes.\n</li><li>when sending from linux to windows you'll end up with all slashes converted to backward slashes.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>the last case is slightly problematic, as a backslash is a valid character in linux filenames.  however, that was a problem before this ticket.\n\n</p><p>finally, when it comes to backwards compatibility, windows could already deal with forward slashes in the path names, so changing the behavior to the above is Stricly Better(TM).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jan-18 16:15:12 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\ni have a patch for V7_8-branch already done.  it can't be merged forward cleanly yet due to the new directory-remapping changes that were made in V7_9_2.  when both are done i will push.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Nov-26 13:57:07 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nI found this while looking for another bug ticket.
