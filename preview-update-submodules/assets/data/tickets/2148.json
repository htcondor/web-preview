{"id": 2148, "title": "Ticket #2148: kill_sig only works once in vanilla universe.", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen I specify <code>kill_sig</code> for a vanilla job, then first time it vacates I get the signal specified. After the job goes to idle, then reruns, I fail to get the signal again at vacate time. It is as if the signal is only sent on the FIRST vacate boundary.\n\n<p>I was told the signal handling semantics for jobs changed very recently, so this could be an introduced bug.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-May-10 11:15:12 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSo strange.\n\n<p>Pete, esp since you have a simple test for this, please add a regression test to detect this problem. Could this be related to work done in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1198\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1198'); return false;\" title=\"remove_kill_sig and kill_sig not used by condor_rm in vanilla universe\">#1198</a></span> ?  If it is, I suppose a regression test would figure that out.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-May-10 11:50:11 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nHrm, when I pared down my shell script to produce a small example, the problem went away and I received the signals as expected. So, likely the problem is in my shell script, but I won't abandon this ticket until I can confirm where the bug is.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-May-10 14:34:54 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I will abandon this ticket.\n\n<p>The \"bug\" I found was that the shell wasn't flushing all of its output before dying and it took the output with it that I was expecting. I did a terrible hack in the shell script to slow it down before dying and now see the output that I expect.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-May-10 14:35", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2011-May-10 10:47", "fixed_version": "2011-May-10 10:47", "broken_version": "v070601", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu, rrati@redhat.com, jthomas@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
