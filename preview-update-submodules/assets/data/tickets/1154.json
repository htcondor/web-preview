{"id": 1154, "title": "Ticket #1154: Tests should know / report own description and classes", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently the description for a test is in the Imakefile, along with which classes the test is in.  Further documentation is sometimes present in testmethods.txt.  This is clumsy.  A test should be more self contained.  Perhaps each test (that is, .run file) should understand \"--describe\" which will return something like this:\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">brief=Condor-C AB test\nlong=This test verifies a basic condor-c job can be submitted to A and run on B and complete.\nimplementation=Two condor pools are set up with dynamic address and predefined locations to read the port. Then the one configured as the A sends the job off to the B side. Expected result: job completion on the A side.\nclasses=condorc,quick,full,quicknolink\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>To generate the list_*s, you'd run --describe on each script to get the classes. To generate the *.desc files (are those used for anything?), you'd do the same. We cuold also use it to generate documentation if the urge struck us.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Jan-28 16:12", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Jan-28 16:12", "fixed_version": "2010-Jan-28 16:12", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#1124", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
