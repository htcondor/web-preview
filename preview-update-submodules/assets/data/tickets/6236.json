This was originally written assuming one annex daemon per system, so recovery consists of being restarted by the master and picking up where the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAdLog\" title=\"Class Ad Log\">ClassAdLog</a></span> indicates we left off.  That's probably not a good assumption for a command-line tool, but it may be worth preserving if we turn the command-line tool into a per-user daemon.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-May-19 10:34:32 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/e6c617e8c311be96aff39f611bef80a0812c9aab\">[50687]</a></span> moved condor_annex logging to ~/.condor (the user config directory); will adjust ticket to reflect.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-May-19 10:38", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Apr-26 17:15", "fixed_version": "2017-Apr-26 17:15", "broken_version": "v080700", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Annex", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#6111", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
