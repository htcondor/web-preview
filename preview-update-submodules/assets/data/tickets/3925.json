(And I suppose there may be other orphaned masters that also require a manual reconfig, but I don't know how I would find them...)\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jan-12 10:22:45 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nIf there's no update on this, I'm going to resolve it.

(Or otherwise waiting for me to send logs?)  I'd like this not to be marked as resolved.  (Abandoned maybe, if you don't care, but not resolved.  I'm pretty sure I wasn't imagining things.)\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jan-12 13:33:33 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nNever mind; I hadn't remembered that this, while quite real, was only happening on one machine.  I'm willing to chalk it up to sunspots unless/until I see it again.
