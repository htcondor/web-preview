{"id": 7002, "title": "Ticket #7002: Fix ClassAds lexer to not read unneeded characters", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> lexer always reads one character beyond the last token consumed, even though it often doesn't need to. It frequently pushes these characters back into the input source, then usually re-consumes them when the next token is requested. When a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> is parsed, the character after the end of the ad is pushed back but not re-consumed before the parse method returns.\n\n<p>We'd like to avoid pushing back characters when possible, especially when it happens on the return of a successful parse. Here are two concrete problems that can result:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>When a FILE is open in text mode, the file position is undefined until a pushed-back character is re-consumed.\n\n<p></p></li><li>In the Python 3 bindings, each parse call creates a temporary FILE around the file descriptor obtained from Python. If a parse operation finishes with a character pushed back into the stream via ungetc(), it will be lost in subsequent I/O, including another parse call. In particular, if a stream contains two <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> with no intervening whitespace, parsing the second one will fail:\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>[ A=3 ][ B=true ]\n</pre></div>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-May-15 14:54:52 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe user visibility of this change is pretty obscure.
