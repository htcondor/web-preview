Shouldn't the schedd be able to control how and when jobs are started--that being the function of the schedd? How is this throttling feature set of dagman a super set of the schedd and should that super set be subsumed into the schedd?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Mar-24 14:59:35 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nCurrent plan:  introduce a new subsection of FAQs that address issues for users dealing with really big jobs/computations/parameter sweeps/etc.  Then, answers to questions can be placed directly in the FAQ, or in this ticket's case, include a link to a subsection within the DAGMan section which addresses this issue.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jul-26 10:59:28 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nNew prose is completed and in the 7.4.3 (and 7.5.3) and future releases.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2010-Jul-26 11:00", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Aug-10 15:05", "fixed_version": "2009-Aug-10 15:05", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
