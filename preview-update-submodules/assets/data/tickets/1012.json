If preen does not find \".proc\", it wants to know if <em>any</em> jobs exist w/ the cluster number found in the filename. Preen does this by trying to fetch the cluster ad from the schedd (job number XXX,-1), which should exist if and only if there is one or more jobs submitted into this cluster number. The problem is the schedd's rpc handler for <span class=\"quote\">GetJobAd</span> in <a class=\"file\" href=\"rlog?f=src/condor_schedd.V6/qmgmt_receivers.cpp\">/src/condor_schedd.V6/qmgmt_receivers.cpp</a> will <em>always</em> try to expand $$() macros, because the <span class=\"quote\">GridManager</span> relies on this behavior.  But cluster ads will never successfully expand, thus the problem.\n\n</p><p>The fix should do the following:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li><span class=\"quote\">GetJobAd() </span> in qmgmt_receivers should check for valid ranges of cluster and proc, and should invoke <span class=\"quote\">GetJobAd</span> <em>without</em> expansion if and only if the proc requested is -1.  This will still allow preen to quickly check for the existence of a any job in a cluster and yet not setoff this bug.\n\n<p></p></li><li>holdJobRaw() in the schedd should do sanity checking on cluster and proc ids, and disallow proc values of -1.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>As a tangent, preen is inefficient if the job queue is large - need a subticket to address this.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jun-24 11:41:53 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nNote: before the patches created in this ticket, in addition to the bugs above, folks running a CCB broker (collector) on the same machine with a schedd will see all their standard universe jobs and/or spooled jobs go on hold with the same crazy -1 jobid email message.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Jun-24 11:24</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/77b4c11d733141b68615febc9c6e757c1ba83af6\">[18512]</a></span>: Fixed bug that could cause the schedd to segfault when preen discovers a CCB reconnect file in SPOOL, which results in preen requesting cluster -1 to the schedd.
