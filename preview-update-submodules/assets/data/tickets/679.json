{"id": 679, "title": "Ticket #679: Add unalterable field to unified param table record", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf it doesn't already exist: In the record for each config knob in the grand param table, we need a field that flags a knob as <em>unalterable</em>.  The idea is if a knob is flagged unalterable, the value for that knob will be the default as specified in the table <em>and the value cannot be changed by the config file or environment variables</em>.  In other words, the value for the knob is hard-coded into the binary, and nothing a user can do can change it (short of binary editing the executable).</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Mar-30 14:08", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Aug-20 05:47", "fixed_version": "2009-Aug-20 05:47", "broken_version": "v070302", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#123", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
