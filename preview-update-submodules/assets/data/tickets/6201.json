I presume it is shorthand for \"\\=!\\=\"?\n\n<p>Hopefully you know what I mean as the equals sign is a special character in your markup language.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Mar-22 16:40:06 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nThe \"is\" operator appears not to be used even by example.

As they don't provide any semantic difference, and it was possible that people were mixing and matching versions, we haven't gone our of our way to document them, but they do show up in funny places from time to time.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Sep-26 13:57:50 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nThe takeaway for me is that \"is\" and \"isnt\" are new and not going away rather than that they are ancient and could disappear.\n\n<p>Let me know if that's wrong. It reads much more \"Pythonically\" so I prefer to use them.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Sep-26 16:04:45 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nCorrect, they are not old and going away, they are new as of 7.x (7.2 I think?) and not going away.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Oct-23 11:01</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/6d685259ffe86ab38d42fed1c4733590f4eb6d1a\">[55608]</a></span>: Add is and isnt into the HTCondor classad section of the manual. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6201\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6201'); return false;\" title=\"isnt operator does not appear to be defined 8.6.1 manual\">#6201</a></span>  (By John (TJ) Knoeller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2018-Oct-23 14:40", "status": "resolved", "created": "2017-Mar-22 16:33", "fixed_version": "2017-Mar-22 16:33", "broken_version": "v080601", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tpdownes", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
