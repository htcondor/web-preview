So, blahp and cream don't run our custom unordered_map feature detection code, and then all kinds of bad things happen.  I talked it over with jfrey, who suggested that instead of doing ifdef HAS_TR1_UNORDERED_MAP, we have cmake emit the correct header file for classads.\n\n<p>Or, we could just drop all compilers that don't support TR1 for condor 7.8....</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Oct-30 12:12</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/2400d55a5e693a9cb506d1464fc611f64d060ddd\">[28049]</a></span>: Switch classad to use tr1 hash tables <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2269\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2269'); return false;\" title=\"Deprecated header usage in GCC 4.6.0\">#2269</a></span> Let's see if this works.
