{"id": 1433, "title": "Ticket #1433: condor_submit option SUBMIT_SKIP_FILECHECKS is borken", "description": "<blockquote>\ncondor_submit has a nice option called SUBMIT_SKIP_FILECHECKS. It should be equivalent to the -disable option, which disables checks for files.\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the option is broken. I traced through the code, and it appears that param() is called on this option before the submit file is read, so it always appears to be undefined. Presumably you \"simply\" need to reorder the code, but I don't know if it's actually that simple, or if you need a deeper solution.\n\n</p><p>(Incidentally, this happens to also be true of SUBMIT_MAX_PROCS_IN_CLUSTER).\n\n</p><p>I would like to see this bug fixed. Hopefully it's a simple fix--can it be scheduled for an upcoming release please? Ideally in Condor 7.4.x, but certainly in Condor 7.5.x.\n\n</p><p>Thanks!</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Jun-08 13:40:45 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nSeems to work fine...\n\n<p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>$ condor_version\n$CondorVersion: 7.4.3 Jun  3 2010 BuildID: RH-7.4.3-0.18.el5 PRE-RELEASE $\n$CondorPlatform: X86_64-LINUX_RHEL5 $\n\n$ echo 'cmd=/bin/true\\ninput=in\\nqueue' | condor_submit\nSubmitting job(s)\nERROR: Can't open \"/home/matt/in\"  with flags 00 (No such file or directory)\n\n$ echo 'cmd=/bin/true\\ninput=in\\nqueue' | condor_submit -disable\nSubmitting job(s).\n1 job(s) submitted to cluster 4709.\n\n$ echo 'cmd=/bin/true\\ninput=in\\nqueue' | _CONDOR_SUBMIT_SKIP_FILECHECKS=TRUE condor_submit\nSubmitting job(s).\n1 job(s) submitted to cluster 4710.\n\n$ echo 'cmd=/bin/true\\ninput=/tmp/in\\nqueue' | condor_submit\nSubmitting job(s)\nERROR: Can't open \"/tmp/in\"  with flags 00 (No such file or directory)\n\n$ echo 'cmd=/bin/true\\ninput=/tmp/in\\nqueue' | condor_submit -disable\nSubmitting job(s).\n1 job(s) submitted to cluster 4712.\n\n$ echo 'cmd=/bin/true\\ninput=/tmp/in\\nqueue' | _CONDOR_SUBMIT_SKIP_FILECHECKS=TRUE condor_submit\nSubmitting job(s).\n1 job(s) submitted to cluster 4713.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Will you provide a failing example?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jun-08 14:30:00 by roy:</em> <br/>\n\nI misunderstood the code--I got confused between condor_param() to read the submit file and param() to read the config file.\n\n<p>I agree that it's not technically a bug, so I now change it to a feature request: I think that people should be able to specify this option in the submit file.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Jun-08 15:01:01 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nSounds like a very reasonable feature, and even quite simple to implement.
