And, identify that in some still-existing, but older documentation, they are the same thing.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jun-11 17:02:54 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSeems like user log is ambiguous and confusing.  This is not a log per user, nor is it a log about users.  It is a log of events that happen to a job, so I think we should call it a <strong>job event log</strong>.  Thoughts?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-11 17:11:23 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nI don't really care what we call it, but I want the name we use to become consistent throughout the manual (and eventually other materials, like our tutorials and usage info printed out by commands, which say user log).  Discussed with Greg, who reminds us that they are not really job logs either, since they are not per-job.  Multiple jobs can share (append to) a single log.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jul-26 10:37</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/53ca3c67b19925872fe9820bc26c81614ee324bf\">[37007]</a></span>: make name of log produced by log= command in submit desc. file consistent throughout manual.
