{"id": 2054, "title": "Ticket #2054: hfs looping on \"group quota exceeded\"", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn old code, the cleanup of usage values and \"pruning\" of a group from further\nnegotiation was done immediately after negotiation of that group. Part of this\nwas setting a flag that would halt negotiation. And part of this was setting\ngroupArray[i].numsubmits == 0, which would then hit\n\n<p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">if (  groupArray[i].numsubmits == 0  ) {\n...\n   continue;\n   }\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This would skip negotiation for this group in the next iteration. The group\nwould be pruned from all subsequent negotiation. The flag was a defensive\nmeasure taken due to comparison of doubles. In new code, negotiation for all\ngroups is done followed by a new loop that does the clean up. There is no flag\nand the groups are not pruned immediately.\n\n</p><p>Repro:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">NUM_CPUS = 100\nGROUP_NAMES = a, b\nGROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_a = .4\nGROUP_QUOTA_DYNAMIC_b = .6\nGROUP_AUTOREGROUP_a = FALSE\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The create a number of different users for group a.\n\n</p><p>Like 5 users ranging from a.a1 to a.a5.\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">executable =./sleep.a1\narguments = 600\nuniverse = vanilla\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\n+AccountingGroup = \"a.a1\"\nqueue 200\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Let the jobs fill the 40 slots and then\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>grep exceeded NegotiatorLog\n\n04/05/11 11:56:55       Rejected 1444.8 a.a4@basin.redhat.com\n&lt;166.217.160.21:41826&gt;: group quota exceeded\n04/05/11 11:56:55       Rejected 1443.8 a.a3@basin.redhat.com\n&lt;166.217.160.21:41826&gt;: group quota exceeded\n04/05/11 11:56:55       Rejected 1442.8 a.a2@basin.redhat.com\n&lt;166.217.160.21:41826&gt;: group quota exceeded\n04/05/11 11:56:55       Rejected 1445.8 a.a5@basin.redhat.com\n&lt;166.217.160.21:41826&gt;: group quota exceeded\n04/05/11 11:56:56       Rejected 1441.7 a.a1@basin.redhat.com\n&lt;166.217.160.21:41826&gt;: group quota exceeded\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>In scenarios with lots of users like 100, you will get 100 rejections for\n\"group quota exceeded\".

There are a number of changes in code flow, variable names, whitespace, comment style, variable declaration placement---all of which do not really seem fundamental to the patch.\n\n</p><p>That said, \"submitterAds\" is a much better name than \"scheddAds\" :).\n\n</p><p>I am concerned about the change in what happens when the submitter limit is reached.  Previously, this resulted in result=MM_RESUME, which (if I understand things correctly), resulted in the submitter remaining in line for consideration in future spins of the pie.  In the patch, this case is handled by removing the submitter from the list of submitters, so I think this means this user will not be considered in subsequent spins of the pie:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>            if (!ignore_submitter_limit &amp;&amp; ((submitterLimit &lt;= 0) || (pieLeft &lt; minSlotWeight))) {\n                // If limit is 0, and we are respecting submitter limits, don't waste time with negotiate\n                negotiation_cycle_stats[0]-&gt;submitters_share_limit.insert(submitterName.Value());\n                dprintf(D_FULLDEBUG, \"Submitter %s is at its submitter limit %g\\n\", submitterName.Value(), submitterLimit);\n                submitterAds.Remove(submitter);\n                continue;\n            }\n</pre>\n\n<p>In general, this seems like a pretty aggressive patch for a stable series.  This makes it hard to be confident that no surprises are introduced.  I'd recommend splitting this into two patches: one suitable for the stable series that fixes the problem with minimal code disturbance, and another with all the other improvements to the code.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-18 17:44:07 by eje:</em> <br/>\n\nOuch, good catch -- shouldn't remove submitter on hitting submitter limit.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-25 14:02:42 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nLooks good!
