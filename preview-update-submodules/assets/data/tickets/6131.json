The result is only partial records are written, the schedd keeps running, and \"appends\" another record.  To better handle this, we should consider:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>the classad log and event log code could use the linux system call to pre-allocate (reserve) disk space for the log, say 32 MB at a time, and reserve another 32 MB when some low-water mark (5MB?) is reached.\n\n<p></p></li><li>the schedd, upon restart, could truncate the log at the spot of corruption.  in practice, this is what a sysadmin would end up doing 95% of the time anyhow, so we could save them the hassle.  I.e. recover from the corruption the best we can instead of simply refusing to start the schedd.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Feb-22 15:13:19 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSee <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6153\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6153'); return false;\" title=\"Fix corruption of job queue log when write fails\">#6153</a></span>, which hopefully fixed the primary culprit of the log getting corrupted in the first place.\n\n<p>And see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6154\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6154'); return false;\" title=\"Remove ClassAd log transaction backup file feature\">#6154</a></span>, which adds the filename to the error message as requested.\n\n</p><p>As such, I am abandoning this ticket.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2017-Feb-22 15:13", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2017-Feb-07 12:22", "fixed_version": "2017-Feb-07 12:22", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#4555", "creator": "blin", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "blin@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
