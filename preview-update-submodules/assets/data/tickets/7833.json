Let's extend the <code>gwdata_plugin</code> to support x509 authentication, assuming the user has a local certificate giving them the required access.\n\n</p><p>This is a stub ticket for now, which I'll update later with more specific technical details.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Sep-29 10:46:15 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nMark says he can reproduce the problem and is working on it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Dec-04 10:48:08 by coatsworth:</em> <br/>\n\nI am closing this ticket, we are continuing this work in <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-109\">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-109</a>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Dec-04 10:50", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2020-Sep-01 14:10", "fixed_version": "2020-Sep-01 14:10", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "FileTransfer", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "#7250", "creator": "coatsworth", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
