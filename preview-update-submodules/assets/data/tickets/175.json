{"id": 175, "title": "Ticket #175: Create and document some SOAP examples in one of the trendy languages.", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt would be nice to have some samples that demonstrate using Condor via the SOAP interface. These examples could do simple things like being a basic condor_q or more be slightly more complex and demonstrate how to submit a job. It seems to make sense to write these in some of the more trendy languages, like Python, Perl, PHP, C#, etc. since they will most likely be of interest to the build of our current and future SOAP users (my choice of languages is purely a conjecture, but I believe it is well founded, given the current interest in web-services and the relation between them and these languages).</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Mar-12 11:45:51 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nTrendy?
