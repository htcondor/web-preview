{"id": 2918, "title": "Ticket #2918: Execute slots should advertise supported file transfer plugin methods", "description": "<blockquote>\ncurrently, the types of file transfer plugins that a given execute slot supports is not advertised in the machine ad, which makes it possible for a job to land on a machine which does not support either its input or output file plugins.  the job will then of course fail.\n\n<p>this makes it difficult to use file transfer plugins in situations where you may be flocking or don't know the configuration of the execute machines.  if the list of supported plugins was advertised, it could then be added to the job's requirements. (this could/should be automatic, but that's not part of this ticket)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Apr-03 16:26</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/1c5a94ea71afd796ca5adc30fc88c7ee54a7bf0e\">[31092]</a></span>: machine ads now advertise which file transfer plugin methods are supported so they can be used for Matchmaking (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2918\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2918'); return false;\" title=\"Execute slots should advertise supported file transfer plugin methods\">#2918</a></span>)  (By Zach Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Apr-03 16:30", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Apr-03 16:25", "fixed_version": "2012-Apr-03 16:25", "broken_version": "v070400", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "#241", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": "20120403"}
