While this should have been noticed earlier in the release process, it could have caused the release to have been delayed.\n\n<p>Merging the patch into the mainline should prevent this problem from reoccurring, as well as simplify building the bindings for pip.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Jan-01 13:52:31 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nI boldly claim this will have no user-visible effect, and as such, does not require documentation.
