{"id": 3532, "title": "Ticket #3532: Anonymously report software metrics", "description": "<blockquote>\n(This is from Karan Vahi at ISI.)\n\n<p>As part of the SI2 proposal, one of the requirements imposed on us by NSF is\nto track usage of the software.\n\n</p><p>For Pegasus 4.2, we implemented reporting of anonymous metrics to a server\nat ISI in the planner.\nAn overview of that is covered here\n\n</p><p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/latest/funding_citing_usage.php#usage_statistics\">http://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/latest/funding_citing_usage.php#usage_statistics</a>\n\n</p><p>However, to close the loop we need to have metrics reporting in Condor\nDAGMan also.\n\n</p><p>Ewa and Miron talked about it last week.  He mentioned that it might be\npossible to implement this in DAGMan .\nBy default in the planner we have metrics reporting turned on. However, for\nDAGMan it was felt that it should be enabled initially only for Pegasus\nworkflows.\nThat should be possible for us to do , when we launch dagman for Pegasus\nworkflows.\n\n</p><p>The configuration is controlled by an environment variable that is set in\nthe environment. We could use that or pass a specific command line option to\ndagman.\n\n</p><p>We have covered some metrics that will be useful for DAGMan to report.\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://confluence.pegasus.isi.edu/display/pegasus/DAGMan+Metrics+Reporting\">https://confluence.pegasus.isi.edu/display/pegasus/DAGMan+Metrics+Reporting</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Apr-09 15:25:10 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nThe confluence ticket nicely states what to report and when to report (ie. when DAGMan exits), but we need to agree on a few details such as what happens if there is a failure to report, what happens if DAGMan exits prematurely, trust model (could any random person anywhere start updating these statistics?).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-10 11:53:20 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nIf we're ever going to do this for workflows that aren't Pegasus workflows, we need some kind of non-Pegasus unique ID for a workflow.  I think the minimum would be something like schedd name and cluster ID, but we should think about whether that's good enough to be sure to be unique.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-10 14:32:28 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nAs per previous emails with Karan, here are a couple of issues:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>How often do we want to report the statistics?  We at least want to do the beginning and end of the DAG, I think.  We should figure out, though, whether we might ever want to set things up to periodically report the stats during the run, because that will affect the design.\n\n<p></p></li><li>We probably also want to add rescue DAG number to the things we report.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-10 17:05:03 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom ToddT:\n\n<p>Thanks Kent.  Added to my list of concerns above to be addressed in the\ndesign doc is impact on resource consumption and performance. For instance,\nif we must connect to the stats server at the start of dagman (instead of\njust the end), it should be a non-blocking connect &amp; write or ???.  Also\naddress in the design doc the impact to our Privacy Policy; see\n\n</p><p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/1_8Privacy_Notice.html#1525\">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v7.8/1_8Privacy_Notice.html#1525</a>\nI'd like something to prevent making it complicated for a user to turn off\nreporting, e.g. if a user desires no reporting to happen from either DAGMan\nor other HTCondor components, they should be able to change just one knob.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\nPossible answer to the privacy issue:  DAGMan could look at the CONDOR_DEVELOPERS setting, and if it's undefined not send the reports, even if the pegasus-plan configures things to send them.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-25 16:09:49 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Design Review</strong>\n\n<p>Review of design doc version attached Jun 21.\n\n</p><p>Please address the following:\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>There is important nuggets of wisdom scattered all over - in this document, in the ticket text, in the confluence ticket (which contains the list of metrics), in a requirements doc, in an 'example braindump' file, in another file that shows example dag output.  Put all this into ONE document and get rid of the other six attachments.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Restructure so it fits the <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=DesignDoc\" title=\"Design Doc\">design doc outline</a></span>.  Most important, first talk about what you are trying to do and why <em>before</em> going into classes and methods.\n\n<p></p></li><li>In second paragraph it says <em>variables and reads the braindump.txt file</em>... I have no idea what a <code>braindump.txt</code> file is about or the information it is communicating.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Are metrics kept/reported by default, or only if <code>-nometrics</code> is specified?  Doc is unclear.  I thought the originally idea was to only report metrics only originating from Pegasus workflows.  This implies to me that <code>-nometrics</code> should be the default, and Pegasus would opt-in via running dagman with <code>-wantmetrics</code>.  Why incur this overhead for non-Pegagus situations? Also why just a command-line flag?  If it was a config knob (perhaps in addition), then metrics could be enabled via environment variables or machine-wide via config file.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Unclear how nested dags are handled.  Are metrics only kept for the top dag?  Are metrics collapsed from child dags to the top dag?  Are metrics kept disjoint across parent/child nested dags?  The first paragraph says we need to have seperate numbers due to seperate dags, but makes no clear statement about what the intended operation will be.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Be sure to address questions in earlier remarks, e.g. what happens if DAGMan exits prematurely (and/or rescue dag -- are stats reported twice?), what is the trust model when reporting the statistics via curl.  Also nothing stated re previous questions like integration with <code>CONDOR_DEVELOPERS</code> so there is one knob to control privacy reporting.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Is there any utility or capability for keeping metrics w/o reporting over the network to curl?\n\n<p></p></li><li>Performance impact: how long are we willing to wait to report the metrics? If I have a workflow with a hundreds nested dags will i make 100 curl connections? How will performance impact be tested?\n\n<p></p></li><li>On regression tests explicitly testing the metrics functionality, I understand how metrics can be turned on and then the metrics file examined for correctness.  But how/will any integration regression testing happen?  Will some tests also update via libCurl to the Pegasus server?  Doing so probably does not make sense unless there is a way to read the data back from the server.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Exceptional cases: what happens when workflow is removed? held and released? held and then removed? I honestly cannot tell from reading the design doc in its current form.\n\n<p></p></li><li>Design doc should have the definitive plan.  Statements like <em>I think that the overall DAG should be</em> and <em>I think we should update</em> do not have a home in a design doc.  State the intended behavior that will be implemented (not necessarily all the details of how it will be implemented) and why.  If there are other things you are not sure about, add a <code>Possible Future Work</code> section to speculate about things that could be thought about more.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>Hope the above helps.  Thanks!\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-25 16:54:01 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI'll restructure things into a single doc (according to the format).  I think a lot of the issues you raised are actually dealt with if the requirements doc and design doc are read together, so it's not so much a matter of new material as of combining and formatting (although there are a few new issues).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-27 17:54:10 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nArgh -- just realized that there's a problem with my plan for calculating the total_job_time -- we need to only use the first execute event for a given job proc.  I'll have to think about the best way to deal with that...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-28 11:07:50 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nDesign document states:\n\n<p></p><div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nSo turning off the HTCondor reporting (unsetting the CONDOR_DEVELOPERS  configuration macro) will override the settings for the workflow metrics.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>Note that unsetting the <code>CONDOR_DEVELOPERS</code> macro does not disable reporting; to disable reporting, the macro must be set to a value of <code>NONE</code>.  See <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.0/3_3Configuration.html#param:CondorDevelopers\">the manual</a>.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-28 11:15:00 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOops, I missed that somehow.  Okay, so setting CONDOR_DEVELOPERS to \"NONE\" will prevent workflow metrics from being reported, as well.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-29 14:45:18 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nI believe I have the dagman_metrics_reporter executable done, and I have DAGMan forking it to report to the server.  Kent, will you review it and let me know what needs to change?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jun-30 06:01:04 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nNote that I added a new knob: <code>DAGMAN_PEGASUS_REPORT_METRICS</code>, which should default to <code>$(LIBEXEC)/condor_dagman_metrics_reporter_probe</code>.  This is not in the design document.\n\n<p>I also deviated from the design document by using the following command line interface:\n</p><div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">condor_dagman_metrics_reporter_probe -f &lt;metrics file&gt; -s &lt;dagman status&gt; -d &lt;dag file&gt; -u &lt;url of a metrics server&gt;\n</pre></div>\n instead of a simple <code>&lt;metrics file&gt; &lt;dagman status&gt;</code> command line.  You need to specify the dag file to generate the name of the metrics.out, and I used the <code>-u</code> url in testing my code.  This command line should probably be normalized and be less ad hoc---on the other hand, there should never be a reason for a normal user to use this (hence it is in libexec).\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jul-01 07:43:49 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nIt turns out we do not use libcurl on Solaris platform in batlab, so building of the metrics reporter fails there.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jul-01 08:07:21 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nWhat is the best way to sleep(3)?  On linux, you can include &lt;unistd.h&gt;, but that does not seem quite kosher for Windows...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jul-01 08:48:56 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nRe question above on how to <code>sleep()</code> : if you are doing this in HTCondor code (aka something that includes condor_common.h at the start), just go ahead and call <code>sleep(x)</code>, as condor_common.h already includes all the correct header files and macros for both windows and unix.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jul-01 09:38:16 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nAll dagman tests fail in batlab on this branch with the following error:\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code\">07/01/13 09:15:29 Warning:  could not open Pegasus braindump file braindump.txt\n07/01/13 09:15:29 ERROR: Warning is fatal error because of DAGMAN_USE_STRICT setting\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jul-01 10:21:52 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOops -- that's only supposed to be a fatal error if the metrics reporting is turned on.
