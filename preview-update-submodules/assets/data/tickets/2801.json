{"id": 2801, "title": "Ticket #2801: Symlink attack possible in condor_glexec_kill", "description": "<blockquote>\nHi,\n\n<p>It's not a particularly interesting symlink attack, but the first line of condor_glexec_kill is:\n\n</p><p>echo $0 \"$@\" &gt; /tmp/glkout\n\n</p><p>That would allow any unprivileged attacker to overwrite any arbitrary file belonging to the pilot.  Again, I don't think this is a very interesting attack, but maybe someone else out there is very clever.\n\n</p><p>This appears to be debug code that never got scrubbed.  Commit is from 2008, so it's been around for awhile.\n\n</p><p>A quick grep through the code reveals other usage of /tmp, but the other random callsites I selected appear to be protected by safefile_open.  It'd be really nice to collect all the usage of /tmp into a single location so we can easily audit for safety.\n\n</p><p>Brian</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jun-17 14:43:47 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nagree it's not a very interesting attack, but fixed nonetheless.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jun-17 14:42</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/7aab6c73b1443bc6930e7eac4905e6e814c402c8\">[36593]</a></span>: remove old debugging code <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2801\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2801'); return false;\" title=\"Symlink attack possible in condor_glexec_kill\">#2801</a></span> ===VersionHistory:None===  (By Zach Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Feb-11 11:30", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Feb-01 08:30", "fixed_version": "2012-Feb-01 08:30", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
