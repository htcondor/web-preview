{"id": 5664, "title": "Ticket #5664: Review usage of getHostFromAddr().", "description": "<blockquote>\n[See <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5659\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5659'); return false;\" title=\"getHostFromAddr() misparses sinfuls with IPv6\">#5659</a></span> for the genesis of this ticket.]\n\n<p>I'm concerned about not using the Sinful class to do the parsing in getHostFromAddr(); we've already got at least one Sinful format (v1) that it won't handle correctly, and we may make it (or a further revision) the default at some point.\n\n</p><p>We should also take a look at who calls getHostFromAddr(); callers who know they're looking at Sinful strings should just use the Sinful object, instead.  This may simplify things.  (The Sinful object may also have \"hostname:port\" parsing in it for backwards compatibility...)  If we do need getHostFromAddr(), it should probably use the Sinful object.\n\n</p><p>We should also worry about why the callers are obtaining the host name (or IP address -- in the Sinful parlance, the primary address), since we can no longer assume, with shared port and CCB, that those are unique identifiers.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-May-05 16:35", "status": "new", "created": "2016-May-05 16:35", "fixed_version": "2016-May-05 16:35", "broken_version": "v080407", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, jfrey@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
