{"id": 4827, "title": "Ticket #4827: Option to treat absent ads like offline ads", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, the tools in HTCondor to wake up hibernating machines when there are jobs that can run on them only work with offline ads. A machine ad becomes an offline ad if HTCondor initiates the hibernation of the machine. If something else hibernates the machine, then the ad doesn't become an offline ad. It can become an absent ad, but those can't be used to wake up the machine.\n\n<p>It would nice to allow condor_rooster to wake up machines that were hibernated by someone other than HTCondor. There are a couple ways we could do this. First, we could have the negotiator and condor_rooster treat absent ads like offline ads. Second, we could have an option to have the collector convert absent ads to offline ads.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Jan-13 14:56", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Jan-13 14:56", "fixed_version": "2015-Jan-13 14:56", "broken_version": "v080200", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsCM", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "a27754", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
