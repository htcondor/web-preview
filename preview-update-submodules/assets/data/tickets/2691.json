This seems doomed.  I suspect it has been failing for years without notice; the only error is emitted to D_HOSTNAME.\n\n<p>The code in question should be either fixed or removed.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Feb-04 10:12", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Dec-05 13:07", "fixed_version": "2011-Dec-05 13:07", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "adesmet", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
