{"id": 5534, "title": "Ticket #5534: No IPv6 interfaces detected on Windows.", "description": "<blockquote>\nHTCondor's interface detection code uses SIO_GET_INTERFACE_LIST on an AF_INET socket, and doesn't return an IPv6 addresses.  The Windows documentation (<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms741621%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms741621%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>) states that won't work with anything other than IPPROTO_IP.  Quick Googling reveals that other people have tried and failed to get IPv6 addresses with this interface.  The SIO_ADDRESS_LIST_QUERY ioctl can return IPv6 addresses, but it's not clear if it will return both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses at the same time.  Googling reveals that GetAdaptersAddresses() may be the function we want to call.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2016-Nov-16 10:10", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Feb-25 15:19", "fixed_version": "2016-Feb-25 15:19", "broken_version": "v080503", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
