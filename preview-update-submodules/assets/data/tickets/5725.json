{"id": 5725, "title": "Ticket #5725: Think about DAGMan \"authorization\" nodes", "description": "<blockquote>\n(As per discussion in CHTC team meeting today.)\n\n<p>The assumption is that the \"regular\" node jobs (or at least some of them) in a DAG require a certificate that needs human intervention to be renewed (so the DAG would <strong>not</strong> try to renew the cert automatically).  It sounds like there was some earlier discussion of this (which I don't remember being involved in).\n\n</p><p>Anyhow, I guess this is kind of a special case of the \"provisioning node\" idea.  One question is, if the cert expires when jobs are in the queue, what should happen?  This would really depend on the characteristics of the jobs -- e.g., if you can't get your output back once your cert expires, we might as well just remove all of the jobs at that point.  Maybe one way this could be addressed is by allowing ABORT_DAG_ON for the authorization nodes -- if you specified ABORT_DAG_ON, the authorization node failing would abort the DAG; otherwise, I guess it would just mean that no new node jobs would be submitted.\n\n</p><p>(Also see <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5622\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5622'); return false;\" title='Allow \"provisioning\" nodes in a DAG?'>#5622</a></span>: Allow \"provisioning\" nodes in a DAG?)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Jun-14 15:45:26 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nTalked with Miron about this today.
