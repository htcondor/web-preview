{"id": 1384, "title": "Ticket #1384: reduce round-trips between schedd and shadows", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere are numerous interactions between the shadow and the schedd that involve the shadow sending something over a TCP socket and waiting for the schedd to send back a response and then the schedd waiting for the shadow to send the next request.\n\n<p>I found that by removing the round-trip in SetAttribute(), the sustained throughput in jobs/s that the schedd could achieve increased by about 30% (from 169 jobs/s to 217 jobs/s).  This is nearly as much improvement as I observed when completely disabling job queue updates in the shadow, so, although a few more round-trips could likely be removed, it appears that SetAttribute() was the main culprit.  Both of these observations were made with the job queue log on /dev/shm.  With the job queue log on a local disk, I only see about a 15% improvement in throughput, and things are almost entirely limited by fsync.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Apr-30 09:51:02 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nWe see little/no performance benefit on this one.

Although the jobs are 0-second sleep jobs, it seems to often take a second for the starter to complete the task.  I haven't investigated why.\n\n</p><p>With no user log and with spool in /dev/shm, stack sampling of the schedd showed that it was spending a sizable fraction of its time (approx 1/3) waiting for the shadow to respond in the qmgmt command handler.  After removing the round-trips in <code>SetAttribute</code>, it spends much less time waiting on the shadow, and I see about a 30% increase in throughput.\n\n</p><p>At the rate my jobs are running, I find that with more than 400 slots, my schedd can't keep up with all the shadows and I get increased failures.  This decreases throughput somewhat.
