{"id": 3501, "title": "Ticket #3501: Really fix RemoteIwd for PBS/LSF jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nJob attribute <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RemoteIwd\" title=\"Remote Iwd\">RemoteIwd</a></span> doesn't work for blahp-based jobs. The blahp always creates a temporary directory in which to run the job.\nThis doesn't work well for Pegasus, which wants to run each job in a directory that was previously created and populated with files for that job. When using other job types (e.g. vanilla), they rely on <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RemoteIwd\" title=\"Remote Iwd\">RemoteIwd</a></span> to have HTCondor start the job in the desired directory.\n\n<p>Before blahp-over-ssh supported file transfer between the gridmanager and blahp, we co-opted <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RemoteIwd\" title=\"Remote Iwd\">RemoteIwd</a></span> to specify the directory on the blahp machine where job files resided (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2913\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2913'); return false;\" title=\"Fix RemoteIwd for PBS/LSF jobs\">#2913</a></span>). This ticket would modify that behavior to match RemoteIwd's meaning in other job universes.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Feb-19 11:01", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Feb-19 11:01", "fixed_version": "2013-Feb-19 11:01", "broken_version": "v070706", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#2913", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "a24704", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
