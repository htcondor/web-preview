They think the problem may be correlated with the new networking stack that was first rolled out in vista/HPC Server/2k8, and they have definitely seen it with HPCServer 2k3/2k8, Win 2k8.  On these platforms, Cycle reports that the problem can be observed with as few as 12 slots :(. The more slots, the more consistently it happens.\n\n</p><p>One possible (albeit cumbersome) immediate work-around could be to run multiple startds on the same machine, aka 4 startds w/ 8 slots instead of one startd with 32 slots. Perhaps a <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=HowToAdminRecipes\" title=\"How To Admin Recipes\">HOWTO</a></span> article on how to configure multiple startds under one master would be helpful? The HOWOTO could explain how to configure (create log &amp; exec directories, set STARTD_NAME, set master to start them), and also some of the pros/cons (e.g. some STARTD machine ad attributes, like <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=NonCondorLoadAvg\" title=\"Non Condor Load Avg\">NonCondorLoadAvg</a></span>, are system-wide and will no longer make sense if you are running multiple startds).\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Aug-17 12:52:41 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nThis issue seems specific to Windows, as we have often run more than 12 slots on Linux w/o seeing this problem.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Aug-17 12:56:33 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nRandom shot in the dark thought: a quick/dirty look at the logs and it appears the problem manifests when the schedd is activating claims to the startd, the startd times out. Activation will cause the startd to spawn a starter. One difference between Condor on Linux vs Windows is signaling between startd and starter happens via posix signals on Linux, but Windows uses daemonCore created CEDAR sockets causing us to hit a deadlock between schedd, startd, starter ?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Aug-22 08:32:31 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nWhat happens if they change _TIMEOUT_INVERVAL? on the schedd..\n\n<p>E.g. raise all boats just to see what happens.\n\n</p><p><em>2011-Aug-22 13:19:42 by ichesal:</em> <br/>\n\nI raised the shadow and startd timeouts to 20 -- no difference.

Near instant when it works well.\n\n</p><p>For 40 sleep jobs Condor was able to take the machine from empty to all 40 slots running sleep jobs in a few seconds.\n\n</p><p>The bad news:\n\n</p><p>For 40 jobs that do actual CPU-bound processing Condor could only get 33 of the slots running jobs. It did fill them quickly, a few seconds at most before everything was running. The remaining 7 slots refused to run jobs. Run attempts failed because of interprocess I/O errors. These can be seen in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StartLog\" title=\"Start Log\">StartLog</a></span>. I'm attaching all the log files as well as screen cap of the machine in a steady state, 33/40 slots occupied, so you can see over all CPU use from taskman. The configuration used on the machine is also contained in the zip file.\n\n</p><p>This is definitely a better performing Condor release. Even while it was showing interprocess I/O I could still run condor_status -direct against the machine and the startd would respond. In the 7.6.4 release this isn't possible.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Oct-24 16:32:40 by ichesal:</em> <br/>\n\nZip file with the logs and configs is too big to be attached.

This time: logging left at the default level on the STARTD and turned off completely on the PROCD. The jobs were CPU-bound jobs that were expected to run for about an hour each. We left the machine up for about 10 minutes and steady state was 30/40 slots occupied by jobs. The other 10 slots would try to start jobs, fail, repeat.\n\n</p><p>Log files and the config files used are available here: <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/870088/condor/condor-7.6.5-retest-logs.zip\">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/870088/condor/condor-7.6.5-retest-logs.zip</a>\n\n</p><p>Let me know if you need anything else.\n\n</p><p>Thanks!\n\n</p><p>- Ian</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2424\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2424');
