Another option is to just jettison this part of the diagnostic anyway -- it only helps if you're actually expecting your job to be scheduled during the first negotiator cycle anyway.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Jun-02 09:41:55 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nAfter a long discussion, consensus was that users frequently don't care about condor_q -analyze &lt;some random job in a big set&gt;, they really want to easily analyze a set of jobs, and know how many are running, how many aren't, and why they aren't running.  The UX today forces the person who runs condor_q to pick one job, but that's just our convenience speaking.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Jul-21 10:19:04 by pfc:</em> <br/>\n\nTwo action items:\n\n<p>1) Todd M. will implement the removal of the 1 line we all agree is unhelpful.\n\n</p><p>2) Christina will make a specific proposal for initial changes to the rest of the output based on her conversations with James et al, and LIGO will provide feedback. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7234\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7234'); return false;\" title=\"Better support for flocked environments for condor_status and condor_q\">#7234</a></span>\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Aug-18 11:46:47 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nI think that we don't need a version history for this minor change.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7675\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7675'); return false;\" title=\"condor_q -analyze should summarize sets\">#7675</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\ncondor_q -analyze should summarize sets</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Jul-21 11:58</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/a68b5ed01c4aa5397160b17c8e8cbd478e1c59d1\">[60171]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5834\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5834'); return false;\" title='fix misleading message \"Request has not yet been considered by the ma\"'>#5834</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7530\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7530'); return false;\" title='Fix negotiator diagnostic in \"condor_q -analyze\"'>#7530</a></span>) Remove 'Job has not yet been considered by the matchmaker.' as almost always wrong and almost never useful.
