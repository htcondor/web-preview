{"id": 3388, "title": "Ticket #3388: GridJobStatus not updated by SIRs.", "description": "<blockquote>\nAlthough the job is idle, HTCondor <em>is</em> checking the status of the Spot Instance Request.  We should be copying it into the job ad when we do.\n\n<p>In particular, if we report the status-code field in addition to the status field, our users will be better-able to tune their bidding stategy (e.g., from seeing states like 'price-too-low').  This will probably require updating the API date field in the EC2 GAHP.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Jan-02 16:41:27 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nBecause the set of status values for spot and dedicated instances are (currently) disjoint, it will be unambiguous to combine the two into the job ad attribute <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GridJobStatus\" title=\"Grid Job Status\">GridJobStatus</a></span>, and I have a patch ready to so do.  Jaime and I feel that the simplicity and consistency of this approach recommend it over adding a new job ad attribute especially for spot instance request statuses.\n\n<p>The 'status-code' values are also disjoint, and provide more detail than the 'status'.  In particular, \"instance-terminated-by-price\", \"price-too-low\", and \"capacity-not-available\" look potentially valuable for tuning bids.  Given that we don't currently report the SIR 'status', I'd be OK with skipping it entirely, and just sing the 'status-code'.\n\n</p><p>However, it looks like obtaining 'status-code's will require using a new(er) API version.  In practice, I think this will have minimal effect on using the EC2 GAHP with Amazon (which, of course, supports the new API version); but it's unclear what effect (if any) it will have on other services or software, like <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=OpenStack\" title=\"Open Stack\">OpenStack</a></span>.  Creating a binary which specifies the newer version (for testing) won't be time-consuming, but the testing could be.\n\n</p><p>So, Tony: just how interested are you in the bidding information? :)\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-11 17:11:04 by tiradani:</em> <br/>\n\nI am very interested in the bidding information as long as it doesn't break compatibility with <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=OpenStack\" title=\"Open Stack\">OpenStack</a></span> or Eucalyptus.
