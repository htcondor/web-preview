{"id": 5156, "title": "Ticket #5156: Implement MAX_TIME_PER_SCHEDD for negotiator", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn CMS, we're observing that a single schedd has the ability to completely ruin an entire negotiation cycle.\n\n<p>Some of our schedds have 400 submitter ads; when they get overloaded, the negotiator hits a 10s timeout for each submitter.  Since we're on a glidein-based infrastructure, we must keep a limit on our total negotiation cycle time (preferably, no more than 15 minutes) - meaning a single bad schedd can basically stop all negotiation activity.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jul-28 14:16:40 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nTesting this out in CMS-land, it appears to work fine.  Certainly the log lines are much appreciated.\n\n<p>Only complaint is that integers are too coarse-grained for this (lots of negotiation interactions take ~0.4s, which are then rounded down to 0).  This complaint is true for all the MAX_TIME_PER_* knobs so I think we can merge without addressing that if you'd like.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jul-28 16:12:50 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nSome of the time, the interaction should cross a second boundary and be rounded up to 1 second. Across many interactions, I would expect it to even out statistically.\n\n<p>But as you say, that can be treated as a separate issue that affects all of the timing measurements in the negotiator.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Aug-04 21:16:30 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Jaime,\n\n<p>Is this OK to merge to master?
