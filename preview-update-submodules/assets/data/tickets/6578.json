{"id": 6578, "title": "Ticket #6578: VM_Memory ignores RESERVED_MEMORY", "description": "<blockquote>\n<code>VM_Memory</code> is supposed to reflect the memory available for VM's and it defaults to the entire memory capacity of the machine. However, <code>RESERVED_MEMORY</code> was added to allow admins to set aside memory that condor could not use. The default for <code>VM_Memory</code> should be total memory - <code>RESERVED_MEMORY</code>.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2018-Feb-24 15:30:16 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nAs far as I can tell, VM_MEMORY (the startd knob) defaults to undefined, and the VM universe will refuse to run without it explicitly being set.  It's set to $(DETECTED_MEMORY) in <code>/etc/condor/include/startd.conf</code>, line 199, on the machine (e422) that we were looking at on Friday.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2018-Feb-24 15:31", "status": "resolved", "created": "2018-Feb-23 15:58", "fixed_version": "2018-Feb-23 15:58", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#4882", "creator": "blin", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "blin@cs.wisc.edu moate@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
