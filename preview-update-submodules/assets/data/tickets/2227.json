{"id": 2227, "title": "Ticket #2227: Have a way to stop node job submission that doesn't kill DAGMan", "description": "<blockquote>\nLIGO ran into problems with the combination of condor_hold/condor_rm of a DAGMan job goofing things up.  I think that maybe we should change how condor_hold works with DAGMan, or else have some other way of causing DAGMan to stop submitting new jobs, but continue to run and monitor the log files.  That way, if you did condor_hold (or whatever) and then condor_rm, DAGMan would create a rescue DAG that accurately reflected the state of the workflow.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Feb-07 14:56:46 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nThis basically is a duplicate of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2213\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2213'); return false;\" title=\"Condor_hold + condor_rm of DAG doesn't create rescue DAG\">#2213</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-May-03 11:17", "status": "defer", "created": "2011-Jun-13 10:19", "fixed_version": "2011-Jun-13 10:19", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
