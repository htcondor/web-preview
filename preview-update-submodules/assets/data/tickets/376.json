The original ad is first copied wholesale to form the new ad. Then, the original ad is searched for remote_* attributes. For each one, a new attribute is inserted in the new ad with the 'remote_' stripped off and the original attribute name is deleted from the new ad.\n\n</p><p>If the original ad has both remote_foo and remote_remote_foo, and remote_remote_foo is found first, then the translated remote_foo will be deleted when remote_foo from the original ad is processed.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Apr-13 12:22:09 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe solution I'm using is to delete all remote_* attributes from the new ad before translating remote_* attributes from the original ad.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-13 12:27:23 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis same code is in INFNBatchJob, but it doesn't delete any remote_* attributes from the new ad.
