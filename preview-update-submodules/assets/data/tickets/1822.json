{"id": 1822, "title": "Ticket #1822: enforce maximum stage-out size", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere should be an option to limit the total size of output files staged out from each job.  The user should be able to specify a limit on a per-job basis and the schedd admin should be able to specify a limit that applies schedd-wide.  If the admin's limit is less than the user's specified limit, then the admin's limit should win.\n\n<p>The scenario that motivated this proposal was a case encountered at Nebraska in which a user ran 100 jobs that each staged out 5GB of data, filling up the home partition, and interfering with other work.\n\n</p><p>It would be nice to also limit the total volume of output in some way, but it is more straightforward to limit things on a per-job basis, and even if we had some sort of cross-job quota, it would still make sense to be able to limit output on a per-job basis, so this seems like a good place to start.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Dec-23 11:00:40 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nFor usability/reporting purposes, what do you think of an email and/or a special event in the event logs indicating this limit was hit?\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:20:02 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:21", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Dec-23 09:46", "fixed_version": "2010-Dec-23 09:46", "broken_version": "v070506", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu,bbockelm@cse.unl.edu,tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
