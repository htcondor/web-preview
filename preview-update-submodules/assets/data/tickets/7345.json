Probably in both the <code>Schedd</code> docstring, and in some separate section where we explicitly discuss thread safety.\n\n</p><p>If time permits, we could add some quick recipes for getting per-thread objects in a convenient way.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Dec-13 10:30:48 by karpel:</em> <br/>\n\nSuperseded by <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7359\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7359'); return false;\" title=\"Python bindings multi-thread programs crash talking to Schedd\">#7359</a></span></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2019-Dec-13 10:31", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2019-Oct-28 12:35", "fixed_version": "2019-Oct-28 12:35", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "PythonBinding", "assigned_to": "karpel", "derived_from": "", "creator": "karpel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cern", "visibility": "public", "notify": "karpel@wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
