{"id": 5221, "title": "Ticket #5221: condor_q treats -name differently than other tools", "description": "<blockquote>\ncondor_q and condor_rm handle their -name command-line argument differently, which can lead to them talking to difference schedds. condor_rm uses the -name argument value to create a DCSchedd object and uses that object to communicate with the schedd. condor_q uses the -name argument value to query the collector for the given schedd's ad, uses the sinful string from that ad to create a DCSchedd, and uses that object to communicate with the schedd.\n\n<p>When the DCSchedd object is given a name but not an address or pool, it may decide that the named schedd is local and look for its information in a local address file instead of querying the collector. It will do this if the given name matches the SCHEDD_NAME parameter in the config file. If the address file can't read, it falls back to querying the collector.\n\n</p><p>These divergent paths for locating the schedd are causing problems for Fermilab, which runs multiple schedds on a single machine. They have situations where condor_q -name and condor_rm -name contact different schedds, leading to confusion when condor_rm says jobs don't exist.\n\n</p><p>One workaround is to disable the writing of the schedd address and ad files. This would require that all tools be used with -name and they would always query the collector to locate the schedd. Another workaround is to always use -pool, which forces a query of the collector.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Aug-14 13:58:07 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis problem arises when the following config parameters don't refer to the same schedd (in the client's configuration):\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>SCHEDD_NAME\n</li><li>SCHEDD_SUPER_ADDRESS_FILE\n</li><li>SCHEDD_ADDRESS_FILE\n</li><li>SCHEDD_DAEMON_AD_FILE\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Nov-16 11:08:17 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm leary of getting rid of the address files, I think the solution here is to have the use of the -name argument always contact the collector for all of the tools - just like condor_q does now.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Dec-05 15:24:17 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>If this change makes Fermi happy in the short term, then we can release it.\n\n</p><p>But it's the wrong solution.
