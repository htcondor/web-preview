{"id": 940, "title": "Ticket #940: Batch leases for cream jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nWith cream, leases are their own entities. The client creates a lease on the server with a unique name and an expiration date. The client can then associate that lease with any number of subsequent jobs. Lease renewal is done to the lease entity. When the lease expires, all jobs associated with it are removed.\n\n<p>Currently, Condor creates a separate lease for each job. Most jobs could share the same lease. We have discovered that having a separate lease per job has huge performance issues when scaling up to thousands of jobs, on both the client and the server.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Feb-28 18:11:37 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed commit to V7_5_6-branch for 7.5.6.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Feb-28 18:04</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/87471a79ba12d392a1aa3727201dbbc786602215\">[20795]</a></span>: Batch leases for Cream jobs. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=940\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('940'); return false;\" title=\"Batch leases for cream jobs\">#940</a></span> All jobs going to a given Cream server now share the same Cream lease handle, rather than every job having a separate handle.
