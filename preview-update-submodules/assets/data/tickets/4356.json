If we ever do the command-line tool to communicate with DAGMan, this would be an obvious capability for it to have.

Such as:\n<ul>\n<li>If you decrease MAXJOBS, for example, does that remove queued jobs or just not submit until you get down to the new setting?\n</li><li>Would this command just cause DAGMan to re-read whatever existing config files it already knows about?  Or would you also be able to do the equivalent of 'condor_config_val -set'?\n</li><li>What if DAGMan is held and released after setting a specific value?  Should DAGMan save the most recent value somewhere so it re-starts with the most recent value?  (Hmm -- if we do that, maybe it should be an event in the log proposed in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"reviewdesign\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4125\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4125'); return false;\" title=\"Separate log file for POST script terminated events?\">#4125</a></span>?)\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Sep-22 11:45:34 by tpdownes:</em> <br/>\n\nThese are all obvious things a DAG command line tool (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2616\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2616'); return false;\" title=\"Create a command-line tool to communicate with DAGMan\">#2616</a></span>) would do and is not adding helpful information.
