We need to measure both CPU and memory usage of common operations: insert, lookup, parsing, and matching.\n\n<p><span class=\"subsection\"></span></p><h3>Benchmarks to perform</h3>\n\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>A benchmark that instantiates N classads, adds A attributes into it, and then deletes them.

Compare execution time and size b/w new and old classads. <em>Nick</em> <strong>DONE</strong>\n\n<p></p></li><li>Grab the output of condor_status -l off one of the collectors (?) on a pool to get all the machine classads in the pool into a text file. Suck this up into a program which instantiates a classad for each of these machines. (Maybe make 10 instances of classads for each machine to magnify results). Check memory footprint; compare b/w new and old classads. <em>Nick</em> <strong>Done</strong>\n\n<p></p></li><li>Similarly with a job queue, grab the job classads, and suck them into a program which instantiates classads for each job in the text file. (Magnify as needed). Check memory footprint; compare b/w new and old classads. <em>Nick</em> <strong>Done</strong>\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>One of the concerns is that old classads do a reference counting of strings, whereas new classads use C++ strings.

I am wondering, however, why the number of ads that match the constraint varies across the three tests.  Is the input data not controlled?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-01 12:55:04 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nCan you give numbers when running the same constraint on both new and old classads?\n\n<p>They <strong>are</strong> running with the same constraints.  The differences that you see are due to the fact that old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> automagically compare <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=MyType\" title=\"My Type\">MyType</a></span> and <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=TargetType\" title=\"Target Type\">TargetType</a></span> of the ads, and new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> doesn't have such a concept, so I had to build that into my query.\n\n</p><p>Can you explain what the numbers mean? It looks like new classads are 3-4 times slower when matching and 4-5 times slower for whatever ads and view members is?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-01 14:41 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\n\n<p>To Todd:\n\n</p><p>For better or for worse, the current benchmark is told to generate n (in the above case 10000) ads based on a 'snapshot' of condor_status -any -l.  As it goes through and adds more ads, there is a degree of randomness as to which of the original ads (from the snapshot) it bases the next ad to add to the collection from.  So, in one run there might be more schedd ads, then next more X86_64 ads, etc.\n\n</p><p>To Matt:\n\n</p><p>Old classads doesn't have a view concept.  Or, rather it may have at some point (it referended in some header files), but has since been disabled.  New classads collections allows the application to create a distinct 'view' of the collection that matches a given constraint.  In the above, I used 'other.MyType == \"Machine\" to specify the view, so the view view that I then queried is a sub-set of the entire <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> collection.\n\n</p><p>Yes, you're right, the new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> collection code does appear to be slower to query than that of old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>.  That being said, old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> doesn't even <strong>have</strong> a real query -- it allows you to iterate through the collection and pick out ads that match, which is what the current collector does.  I haven't looked at all into any possible optimizations that could be done to new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> collection queries.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-01 15:35:54 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nNick, it is impossible to follow the comments if you edit them instead of appending.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-29 14:58:00 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nOK, I have benchmarks based on walking through an STL list of ads, matching one at a time.  I've run these tests with list&lt;&gt;s of 10,000 up to 50,000 ads.  At 100,000 the image size of the process grew large enough that I eventually gave up and killed the process.\n\n<p>The timings seem pretty consistent..  Old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> do match-making about 5x to 6x faster than new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>.  This is consistent through a wide range of list sizes.\n\n</p><p>Memory use between the two is very close, with new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> consistently using about 96% of the RAM compared to old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>.\n\n</p><p>All of these measurements seem to remain constant with scaling from 10,000 up to 50,000 ads.  At 50,000 ads, new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> contributed 826,428M to the test program's image size, while old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> used 855,816M.  Again, the ratio between the two is very consistent.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-30 15:18:40 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nI just completed an update that allows the test to \"pre-filter\" ads such that it'll run the query against a subset of ads -- in this case jobs with <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=MyType\" title=\"My Type\">MyType</a></span> == \"Machine\".  This had little affect on the performance of old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> (not surprizing), and sped up new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> somewhat.  This was an attempt to better emulate the behavior of the negotiator.\n\n<p>Under these conditions, old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> performed 4.7x faster than new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>.\n\n</p><p>Memory usage patters, not surprisingly, were not affected by this.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Apr-30 15:21:18 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nThis benchmarking work is being done on it's own branch:\nV7_3-new_classads_benchmarks-branch\n\n<p>There's also the V7_3-new_classads-branch branch which is intended to be updates and additions to new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> without the benchmarks.

Several \"classes\" of strings were used, each with a different length range and duplicate probability; however the benchmark itself only \"sees\" a string with a duplication number.

After deleting the ads, the image size and RSS of the old <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> benchmark drops as expected.  With new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>, however, that doesn't appear to be the case.  I've done some reworks on the benchmark apparatus (in case it was the apparatus I was measuring, not the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> code itself), but that had no affect.  At the top of the next loop, both new and old have reduced isize and RSS -- this seems normal.  After the start of the second and each loop after, both had a constant isize and RSS.\n\n<p>For new <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>, this number was 752k (compared to that before the start of the first loop.
