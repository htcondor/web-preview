{"id": 2050, "title": "Ticket #2050: Missing events in Condor-C tests", "description": "<blockquote>\nOn occasion, the Condor-C tests in the test suite will fail via timeout. Investigation reveals that the user log contains only the terminate event. The daemon logs show that they are at least attempting to write the other events and there are no indications of failure to do so.\n\n<p>Greg will enhance the test suite to write to its log whenever it sees an event in the job logs it monitors. We should also change the test suite to always keep global event log, which would provide useful data for failures such as this.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Apr-12 14:45</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/dadf1691ee6485e4040daa1dc9e57ce12e9beb8c\">[21341]</a></span>: Add debug info to Condor tests for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2050\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2050'); return false;\" title=\"Missing events in Condor-C tests\">#2050</a></span> Trying to discover missing user log entries in Condor-C tests.
