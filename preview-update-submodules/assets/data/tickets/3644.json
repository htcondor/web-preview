{"id": 3644, "title": "Ticket #3644: find correct location for files differing between condor rpm versions", "description": "<blockquote>\nBetween the UW/OSG/Fedora versions of the condor RPM, there are some files that do not get installed in the same locations; condor_config.local comes to mind, there may be others.\n\n<p>Find out what all paths differ between the versions, and decide on the correct location for it.  Also, find out which ones are likely to cause trouble if they change.  For example, the location of condor_config.local changing may surprise people or break things, but other things that the user does not touch may not cause any trouble to update.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Aug-19 07:39:01 by edquist:</em> <br/>\n\nThe main unresolved item here was what to do with the (bosco related) campus_factory files:\n\n<p></p><pre>  campus_factory.conf:\n    osg:          /etc/condor/\n    uw:           /usr/libexec/condor/campus_factory/etc/\n</pre>\n\n<p></p><pre>  condor_mapfile:\n    osg:          /usr/share/condor/campus_factory/condor/\n    uw:           /usr/libexec/condor/campus_factory/share/condor/\n</pre>\n\n<p>I am planning to keep the bosco stuff in the osg location, barring objections from FW.
