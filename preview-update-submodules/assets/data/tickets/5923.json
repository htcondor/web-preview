{"id": 5923, "title": "Ticket #5923: JobStartDate is set inconsistently.", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe found that CMS has some code that <em>depends</em> on the fact that <code>JobStartDate</code> is always set when the job is in <code>JobStatus==2</code>.\n\n<p>This seems to usually be a safe assumption.  However, it seems there are some code paths (haven't figured them out) where <code>JobStatus</code> is set in one transaction, then <code>JobStartDate</code> is set in a following transaction.\n\n</p><p>That means there are some cases where the job is running but <code>JobStartDate</code> is unset.
