{"id": 4209, "title": "Ticket #4209: DAG final node goofs up node status file", "description": "<blockquote>\nCMS reported that adding a final node to their DAGs ended up causing the node status file to be incorrect.

(I'm curious whether the FinishedRunning() test fails only with final nodes, or if it fails all of the time but we mostly don't notice the failure because the minimumUpdateTime has elapsed.)\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-12 15:33:17 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Kent,\n\n<p>Do you mean to try the node status with a large update time in general?  This definitely works; we've been using the node_status file to determine whether the task is updated for awhile.\n\n</p><p>Thanks,\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-12 15:38:37 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nBrian, the note above was just a reminder to myself to try that in the test, to try to see whether FinishedRunning() actually works except for certain final nodes, or fails all of the time...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-13 08:35:23 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nIt gets worse --\n\n<p>If we send a SIGUSR1 to one of these tasks, it does not write out the node status file nor does it kill off running jobs.  This causes jobs to \"leak out\" (esp because we map SIGUSR1 to the hold signal).\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-13 14:38:51 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nCreated V8_0-gittrac_4209-branch for this.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-14 09:35:32 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nRe the SIGUSR1 business -- what you describe is pretty much what you should expect when you condor_hold a DAGMan job.  The held state for a DAG is kind of a weird state, especially if you don't eventually do a condor_release on the DAGMan job.\n\n<p>At this point, if you want to suspend submission of new node jobs, I recommend\nthe halt file functionality, instead of condor_hold (see <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.1/2_10DAGMan_Applications.html#SECTION003106000000000000000\">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.1/2_10DAGMan_Applications.html#SECTION003106000000000000000</a>).  When you use a halt file, DAGMan itself is still running, just not submitting new node jobs.  So if you subsequently condor_rm the halted DAGMan, you'll still get a rescue file, etc.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-15 19:27:16 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nActually, no, we want SIGUSR1 to kill off all running jobs and scripts, then write out the node status file / rescue DAG.\n\n<p>The halt file is not usable regardless because we don't have the ability to write to the remote schedd's filesystem.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-17 12:23:26 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nSo what happens if you do condor_rm of a DAGMan?  In the default setup, condor_rm of a DAGMan sends SIGUSR1 to the condor_dagman job, which ends up removing all node jobs and writing a rescue DAG.  I'm curious what's going on if you're sending a SIGUSR1 to a DAGMan and that's not happening.  Can you send a dagman.out file?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-17 12:30:20 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOh, yeah -- if you have a final node, that gets run after DAGMan gets a SIGUSR1.  I just realized that that's not documented...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-17 15:31:24 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi,\n\n<p>There's no way for users to 'condor_rm' the dag; we use 'hold' instead so users can later do a condor_release to resubmit.\n\n</p><p>Once we added the FINAL node, condor_hold (with hold signal set to SIGUSR1; verified the correct signal was delivered via watching the process with strace) does not clean up running jobs.\n\n</p><p>If I would condor_rm the DAG itself, the node jobs would probably be removed via <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=OtherJobRemoveRequirements\" title=\"Other Job Remove Requirements\">OtherJobRemoveRequirements</a></span>.\n\n</p><p>Brian\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Feb-17 16:30:19 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- I'm not sure what's going on here.  The schedd now removes node jobs when a condor_dagman is condor_rm'ed (in case you remove a held DAGMan).  But DAGMan itself still tries to remove the node jobs, too.  Can you send me a dagman.out file from a case where condor_dagman gets a SIGUSR1 but doesn't remove the node jobs and create a rescue DAG?\n\n<p>There's another ticket that might be relevant to this: <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2616\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2616'); return false;\" title=\"Create a command-line tool to communicate with DAGMan\">#2616</a></span>: Create a command-line tool to communicate with DAGMan.

So in the job_dagman_final-I test, for example, node I_C2 is reported as being in the PRERUN status when DAGMan exits.  I think that might end up being kind of confusing...  Maybe this should be split into a separate ticket?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-03 19:35:18 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nHi Kent,\n\n<p>Yes - i think that's really for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4195\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4195'); return false;\" title=\"Add more detail to DAGMan node status file\">#4195</a></span>.

For example, Dag::DoneCycle() returns true for both the abort-A and halt-A tests -- I think that could be fixed by them checking Dag::_dagStatus for the DAG_STATUS_ABORT value, etc.\n</li><li>If I do fix Dag::DoneSuccess(), Dag::DoneFailed(), and Dag::DoneCycle(), I think I can revert a bunch of the (temporary?) changes I made to Dag::DumpNodeStatus() -- that would mean a less-complex overall set of code changes.\n</li><li>I think that Dag::_dagStatus should be updated when a final node finishes, so that it's consistent with other stuff.  (Hmm -- if you condor_rm DAGMan, and the final node fails, should _dagStatus be DAG_STATUS_NODE_FAILED or DAG_STATUS_RM?)\n</li><li>I need to add a new abort-final node-node status file test -- probably commit in 8.0, but only enable it in 8.1 to avoid violating the \"no new tests in stable series\" rule.\n</li><li>I need to add something to the documentation about the final node exit code overriding the abort-dag-on exit code, if you have both.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-05 13:04:38 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nNote to myself again:  What is _dagStatus set to if we're aborting with an exit code of 0? -- Need to check that...\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-06 12:35:33 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nHmm -- when aborting with an exit code of zero, _dagStatus is DAG_STATUS_OK, not DAG_STATUS_ABORT -- so you can't tell from _dagStatus that the DAG has been aborted.  I think we may need a separate flag that tells us the DAG has been aborted, even if the exit code is 0.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-19 13:39:55 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nNotes for reviewer:  V8_0-gittrac_4209-branch contains fixes for both this ticket and the derived ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4248\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4248'); return false;\" title=\"Node status counts are incorrect after DAG abort\">#4248</a></span> (Node status counts are incorrect after DAG abort).\n\n<p>Also, don't waste time by looking at all of the commits individually -- the intermediate commits have a ton of debug code, temporary code, etc., and just looking at the diff between the beginning and end of the branch will be much less confusing.\n\n</p><p>There are a number of new tests on this branch, but they are currently commented out in CMakeLists.txt -- the idea is that the new tests should be enabled once all of this stuff is merged to master/8.1.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Mar-20 12:32:48 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nAnother note for review:  The fundamental fix to this bug is not setting _runningFinalNode (now renamed to _finalNodeRun) to false in Dag::TerminateJob().  When _runningFinalNode got set to false, that goofed up Dag::FinishedRunning(), which could incorrectly return false when we actually <strong>were</strong> done running.
