{"id": 3193, "title": "Ticket #3193: support evaluated expressions in xml query output", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently there is no way to specify that you want an expression to be evaluated when generating -xml or -long output from condor_q and condor_status.  This seems an arbitrary limitation, since one can get evaluated output when using -format in non-xml mode.\n\n<p>Currently, the list of attributes to include in the long/xml output is specified via the -attributes argument.  One possible solution would be to add a new option -expressions that lists expressions to be evaluated.  Perhaps the following syntax would make sense, where each expression is assigned a name that will be used as the attribute name in the output:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    -expressions name1=expr1;name2=expr2;...\n</pre>\n\n<p>If multiple -expressions are specified, they will be appended to the list of expressions.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Aug-16 10:11", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Aug-13 17:29", "fixed_version": "2012-Aug-13 17:29", "broken_version": "v070902", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "isfiligoi@ucsd.edu,dan@hep.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
