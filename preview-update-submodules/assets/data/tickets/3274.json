{"id": 3274, "title": "Ticket #3274: Priv-sep can't track all job disk usage", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen privilege separation is enabled in Condor, if a job creates a directory with restricted access permissions, the starter is unable to calculate the amount of disk used by the job while it's executing. This causes spurious warnings in the starter log and makes it difficult to enforce machine policies that limit the disk space used by jobs.\n\n<p>To fix this, we would have to add a new command to priv-sep.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-Oct-24 13:54:07 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is a duplicate of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1763\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1763'); return false;\" title=\"disk usage not correctly monitored in privsep mode\">#1763</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-Oct-24 13:54", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2012-Oct-17 11:34", "fixed_version": "2012-Oct-17 11:34", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
