Notes:\n<ul>\n<li>This remains off by default.  I'm still worried about a sysadmin getting \"surprised\" and not realizing the PIDs in the logfiles don't match the \"global\" PID.\n</li><li>I noticed that using the \"-n\" flag conflicts with \"-n &lt;instance&gt;\" command to the condor_master.  Rather than change it and run afoul of another daemon's flags, I'd like a guru to suggest something.\n</li><li>On my test box, I found the combination of CLONE_VFORK, CLONE_NEWPID, and using PTRACE on the process caused CLONE_VFORK to not function.  To safeguard against this, I use the same pipe/FD_CLOEXEC as in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1959\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1959'); return false;\" title=\"Implement per-job PID namespaces.\">#1959</a></span>;  the two are complementary.\n</li><li>Dropping the pidfile is handled by daemon-core pre-fork instead of post-fork.  Post-fork, the daemon thinks it is PID 1, making the pidfile less-than-useful.  <strong>Note</strong>: because of this, the new daemon doesn't know to delete the file post-exec and leaves a turd.
