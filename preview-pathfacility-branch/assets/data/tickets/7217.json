{"id": 7217, "title": "Ticket #7217: Singularity jobs need to detect singularity errors", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen HTCondor is configured for the starter to run a job under singularity, it just returns the error code of the singularity exec as the job exit code.  If there is a singularity error, this is returned as a job exit code, so a configuration or system error causes the job to leave the queue.  Just like we do with java universe, we need to differentiate a system or environment error from a job error.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:46:37 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080906 to v080907 using ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:29", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Aug-22 14:37", "fixed_version": "2019-Aug-22 14:37", "broken_version": "v080900", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
