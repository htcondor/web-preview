{"id": 6167, "title": "Ticket #6167: condor_q -reverse should imply -(better-)analyze", "description": "<blockquote>\nOn a recent RUST ticket, the end user was confused about using the -reverse flag. When condor_q -reverse is invoked, it should imply that some analysis is being done. Having it silently ignored was confusing to the user.\n\n<p>-reverse without analyze should implicitly invoke analysis. If that is not easy, perhaps an error message in this case.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Apr-14 11:00:40 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW:</strong> Looks good.\n\n<p><strong>DOC REVIEW:</strong> User docs and version history in place.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Apr-04 14:54</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f61d547e10e09ffc2201c51906a170da66b7724a\">[50407]</a></span>: remove -reverse option from condor_q and replace it with -reverse-analyze; a synonym for -better-analyze:reverse. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6167\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6167'); return false;\" title=\"condor_q -reverse should imply -(better-)analyze\">#6167</a></span>.
