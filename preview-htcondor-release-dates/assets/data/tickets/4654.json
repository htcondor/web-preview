{"id": 4654, "title": "Ticket #4654: Non-awful hold messages for VM Universe", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=HoldReason\" title=\"Hold Reason\">HoldReason</a></span> for VM universe jobs which failed to launch is pretty terrible.  A rough draft of suggestions follows.  One possibility for implementation is to use the param table infrastructure to create an \"error table\" or \"hold reason table\" in which condor_q will look the short-form hold reasons to print out the long-form hold reasons below.  Similar code would be welcomed / required for the (user) job log.\n\n<p>(The instructions for VMGAHP_ERR_JOBCLASSAD_NO_VMWARE_VMX_PARAM are a little different than the others; it's not clear if it's better or not.)\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>VMGAHP_ERR_JOBCLASSAD_NO_VM_MEMORY_PARAM\n\n    The attribute ${ATTR_JOB_VM_MEMORY} was not set in the job ad sent to the\nVM GAHP.

I don't think we make any promises about output\nstability.  What would be better?  A new flag to condor_q that nobody knows\nabout?  Printing the explanations beneath the output?\n\n&gt; Different clients (HTCondor-C, python bindings) would get different versions\n&gt; of the hold message.\n\nThe hold message is the one in the job ad; everybody /except/ condor_q -hold\nsees the same message.\n\n&gt; \"condor_q -af:h ClusterID HoldReason\" would have different hold reasons than\n&gt; \"condor_q -held\"\n\nThis is entirely deliberate; I'm assuming that 'condor_q -hold' is used\nprimarily by users (rather than scripts).\n\n&gt; I worry about using string mangling for the substitution (seems brittle)\n&gt; instead of hold sub-codes.\n\nThis is true.  I suppose hold reason codes and sub-codes are cheap enough to\nadd to the projection.\n\n&gt; You start to get inconsistencies between CLI output and the contents of the\n&gt; classad, which results in things like #4808 which look like a scary\n&gt; maintenance nightmare to me.\n\nAgain, this is entirely deliberate -- we want to give the user more information.\n\n&gt; As string constants are collapsed into a single object by ClassAds, the\n&gt; memory savings of having shorter strings in the schedd are going to be\n&gt; miniscule. On first blush, this approach seems to be problematic versus\n&gt; having the startd set a more reasonable hold reason in the first place.\n\nMy original plan was, indeed, to just set a longer hold reason.  That got shot\ndown by ToddT and TJ; I'm not sure why.  (Perhaps because the strings aren't\ncompressed over the wire?)\n\n&gt; Is there a design doc here?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt; Who did the code review?\n\nFor a feature commit to the devel branch?\n\n&gt; I think this warrants further attention, or at least recording previous\n&gt; discussions onto the ticket...\n\nFair enough.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Apr-22 15:23:40 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom the OSG/HTCondor call:\n\n<p>Is it possible to (cheaply) revise this patch to change the hold message on the server side (Brian has strongest preference to not do this in <code>condor_q</code>)?  Preference would be to get it done in the 8.3 series.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Apr-22 16:12:36 by cat:</em> <br/>\n\nTodd Miller claims that Todd Tannenbaum objected to long messages going over the wire, hence the client-side solution (which in turn may have its own issues).
