{"id": 2379, "title": "Ticket #2379: Starter Pre and Post scripts are not documented", "description": "<blockquote>\nStarter Pre and Post scripts came up in a previous LIGO call.  Anyhow, I can't find <strong>anything</strong> about them in the manual, and I've done a ton of searching.  For info in the code, take a look at baseStarter.cpp script_proc.* in condor_starter.V6.1.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nGreg says that this feature has been present since 2004 (at least).  Is LIGO currently using this undocumented feature, or just asking questions about it?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Aug-17 12:01:34 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm not sure if LIGO is actually using it or not, but I'd guess they are using it, since they're aware of it.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Sep-13 14:21:07 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom Greg T, on Aug 18:\n\n<p>I was going to write up docs on pre and post script, but it seems like the post script doesn't work.  So, let's hold off on docs for now. -greg\n\n</p><p>So, Karen is placing this doc ticket in the stalled state.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Mar-09 17:14:01 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nI've added some simple remarks in the condor_submit man page for these guys.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Mar-12 12:13:19 by smoler:</em> <br/>\n\nMoved defn and rewrote descriptions.  These are implemented with specially-named attributes.  They are not submit commands.  So, description needs to say this, and show a '+' sign in the documentation.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Apr-23 13:02</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/c744b604b8595a14beb39be2a8f7bfcaea386332\">[31808]</a></span>: documentation of starter prescript and postscript needs version history item ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2379\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2379'); return false;\" title=\"Starter Pre and Post scripts are not documented\">#2379</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Mar-12 12:09</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/9510b4eb1b440bfac9f7414fbaded777c28f0372\">[30888]</a></span>: Rewrite explanation of starter pre/post scripts, as they super-special attributes, no submit commands. ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2379\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2379'); return false;\" title=\"Starter Pre and Post scripts are not documented\">#2379</a></span> ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2879\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2879'); return false;\" title=\"Prescripts cause the starter to endlessly re-run the job\">#2879</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2012-May-03 10:50", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Aug-12 11:41", "fixed_version": "2011-Aug-12 11:41", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "smoler@cs.wisc.edu, wenger@cs.wisc.edu, matt@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
