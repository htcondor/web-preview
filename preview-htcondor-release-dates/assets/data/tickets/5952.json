By offering a \"-prepend\" command line option, macros used by includes can take on the desired values.\n\n<p>It may be necessary to make prepended macros immutable, so that a later entry in the submit description doesn't override what was supplied on the command line.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "experimental", "last_change": "2016-Oct-07 15:57", "status": "new", "created": "2016-Oct-07 15:57", "fixed_version": "2016-Oct-07 15:57", "broken_version": "v080507", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tools", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "mvpelletier", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "michael.v.pelletitier@raytheon.com", "due_date": ""}
