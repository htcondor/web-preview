{"id": 592, "title": "Ticket #592: Investigate crondor behavior to better document", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn the manual, in the section <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.2/2_12Time_Scheduling.html#sec:CronTab\">Semantics for CronTab Specification</a>.  \"The day will be the logical or of both [cron_day_of_month and cron_day_of_week].\" This is likely true... unless one of the two, but not both, is set to \"* \". In that case, the \"* \" is probably discarded and treated as an empty set. If this was not the case, setting \"cron_day_of_week=1\" would run on every single day. Someone needs to verify what the code is doing, then update the manual to match.\n\n<p>(Filed as a code defect because someone from the dev team needs to confirm the actual behavior. Once we know that for certain, adding it to the manual becomes a documentation task.)\n\n</p><p>(Extracted from <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=375\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('375'); return false;\" title=\"docs for crondor\">#375</a></span>)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Aug-23 17:07:50 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070402 to v070404 using ./ticket_target_mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-27 16:39:01 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070404 to v070405 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Jun-04 15:03", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jun-22 14:06", "fixed_version": "2009-Jun-22 14:06", "broken_version": "", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#375", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
