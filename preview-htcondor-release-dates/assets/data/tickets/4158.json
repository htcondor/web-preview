{"id": 4158, "title": "Ticket #4158: IPv6: mixed-mode command line tools", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe user-facing command line tools (condor_q, condor_status, etc) should be willing to accept IPv4 or IPv6 addresses where ever IP addresses or sinful strings are accepted.  To the extent possible, they should ignore ENABLE_IPV6/ENABLE_IPV4 on the theory that if the user specifies a disabled protocol, they know what they're doing.\n\n<p>Brian Bockelman has a patch that improves how the tools handle mixed-mode IPv4/IPv6.  Unfortunately Alan's simultaneous changes (forcing higher layer to explicitly specify IPv4 or IPv6 instead of using the global setting) rendered the patch no longer applicable.  <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/bbockelm/htcondor/commit/98041ff7e350026c07e8cdb7f501106a535bcf6f\">https://github.com/bbockelm/htcondor/commit/98041ff7e350026c07e8cdb7f501106a535bcf6f</a></p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2015-Aug-01 21:17", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2014-Jan-15 11:06", "fixed_version": "2014-Jan-15 11:06", "broken_version": "v000000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#4492", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
