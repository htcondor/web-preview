{"id": 7200, "title": "Ticket #7200: GPU Memory Post-Mortems", "description": "<blockquote>\nLIGO is moving forward with running multiple jobs per GPU, but this opens up the possibility of one job catastrophically interfering with the other by over-allocating the GPU's memory.  There does not appear to be a way to prevent this on pre-Volta hardware, but if HTCondor could reliably determine which job caused the problem, or even just what the pre-catastrophe memory usage had been, that would allow mistakes to be corrected.\n\n<p>It seems reasonable to assume that this will require per-job GPU (memory) usage attribution; this ticket is therefore a child of <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7199\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7199'); return false;\" title=\"Monitor GPU memory usage per job\">#7199</a></span>.  Depending on how that ticket progresses, and/or other real-world issues, it is possible that this ticket will result in more a crime-scene investigation report than an indictment.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2019-Sep-18 14:24", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Aug-08 12:51", "fixed_version": "2019-Aug-08 12:51", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#7199", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "peter.couvares@ligo.org, tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
