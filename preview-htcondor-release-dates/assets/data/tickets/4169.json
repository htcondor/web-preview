The proposed patch will\n</p><ol>\n<li>fsync just once after correcting committed run times for all jobs (instead of an fsync per job), and\n</li><li>move the dprintf mentioned from D_ALWAYS to D_FULLDEBUG.</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Jan-23 14:53:02 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong> of <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/d42a7510e2cd4ad4f6c67062ba79bf66f6a626b8\">[39214]</a></span>: Passed.
