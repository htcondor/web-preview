Previous to script detection, any executable name, aside from <code>.bat</code> and <code>.cmd</code>, were treated as Windows binaries.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Jun-12 10:10</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/58863825dfa8880d5d64c719ff67e7586d36a58b\">[14890]</a></span>: Ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=504\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('504'); return false;\" title='The \"scripts as executables\" code incorrectly handles binary names'>#504</a></span>: 16-bit applications with no extension we being runs as regular executable.
