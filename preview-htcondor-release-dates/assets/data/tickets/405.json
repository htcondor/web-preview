There are attributes to control whether vm image files should be transferred from the submit machine or read directly on the execute machine. However, condor_submit assumes the image files are always accessible from the submit machine, as it performs some existence tests. When the files aren't transferred, it's assumed that they are on a shared filesystem. This assumption is consistent with the vanilla universe.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Aug-14 16:59:22 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nWipro's code contribution includes code to read vm cpu usage from the VMware client tools.
