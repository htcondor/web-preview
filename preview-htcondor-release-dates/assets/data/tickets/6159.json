{"id": 6159, "title": "Ticket #6159: Keep GridJobId in in job ad on completion and removal", "description": "<blockquote>\nFor many scheduler types, when a grid universe job enters a terminal state (COMPLETED or REMOVED), the gridmanager clears the <span class=\"quote\">GridJobId</span> attribute in the job ad. This makes it impossible to know where the job ran by looking at the history file. We should change it so that <span class=\"quote\">GridJobId</span> is preserved when a job leaves the queue.\n\n<p><span class=\"subsection\"></span></p><h3>Original Feature Request</h3>\n\n<p>Currently, when the Gridmanager sees that a job it's been tracking has completed, it clears out the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GridJobId\" title=\"Grid Job Id\">GridJobId</a></span> attribute. This makes it difficult to troubleshoot issues that have occurred with jobs in the past. Could we store the previous <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GridJobId\" title=\"Grid Job Id\">GridJobId</a></span> in a classad attribute, say <code>LastGridJobId</code>?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Aug-18 16:05:01 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThere's also a bug in <code>mark_idle()</code> (executed on schedd startup) that can cause the schedd to not remove a REMOVED grid job from the queue if <code>GridJobId</code> is set. The function needs to also check whether <code>Managed</code> is set to <code>ScheddDone</code>. The effects of this are minor, as the job will leave the queue the next time job policy expressions are evaluated.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Oct-13 16:15:39 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>Looks good to me.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2020-Oct-13 16:17:27 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nI don't know that <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/01bd816d2b030f58ac5b5da7b0ca202a9a4f7fdd\">[60482]</a></span> warrants a mention in the release notes, but <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/029342d4c3e3ba76455464d4b5658c527f7804fd\">[60481]</a></span> might.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Oct-19 22:34</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/90be797ef44442afec623d94e15dd1178a74dd68\">[61525]</a></span>: Docs for <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GridJobId\" title=\"Grid Job Id\">GridJobId</a></span> remaining in job ad on completion. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6159\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6159'); return false;\" title=\"Keep GridJobId in in job ad on completion and removal\">#6159</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Aug-19 09:35</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/01bd816d2b030f58ac5b5da7b0ca202a9a4f7fdd\">[60482]</a></span>: In mark_idle(), don't wait for gridmanager when it'll ignore the job <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6159\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6159'); return false;\" title=\"Keep GridJobId in in job ad on completion and removal\">#6159</a></span> The gridmanager ignores jobs with Managed=\"ScheddDone\", and the jobs may have <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=GridJobId\" title=\"Grid Job Id\">GridJobId</a></span> set.
