In particular, DAGManNodesLog is copied to the remote side.

DAGMan will never see a job be submitted, execute, and terminate.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Feb-04 12:16:41 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nFrom a discussion on #discomp: the plan should be to have Condor-C suppress the DAGManNodesLog attribute, verify that that works correctly, and write a job_dagman_condorc regression test to make sure it continues to work correctly.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Feb-19 15:42:54 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI think the initial description is a bit unclear/incorrect -- if I remember correctly, the problem happens when DAGMan uses the <strong>single</strong> default log file for all of the node jobs; if you just have DAGMan use the log files specified in the submit files, things work okay.  So it fails with the default log file, but works if you have multiple log files (it should also work if you specify the <strong>same</strong> log file in each submit file -- it's the \"default log\" specification that goofs things up.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Feb-25 15:49:00 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nCan Igor or Brian try condor-c with the attached patch?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-29 11:08:44 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis problem was triggered by <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2807\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2807'); return false;\" title=\"Have DAGMan use a single node job user log file\">#2807</a></span> with the addition of the DAGManNodesLog job attribute. We need to strip this attribute when submitting a Condor-C job to a remote schedd.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-29 11:49:00 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nThis shows we need a DAGMAN/CondorC regression test.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-29 11:56:04 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nJust a reminder, stripping off the attribute at the Condor-C level will goof up DAGMan, because it will still expect events to be written to the \"workflow log\".\n\n<p>If DAGMan can correctly recognize a job as Condor-C, it can just turn off the \"workflow log\" option at the job level in the DAG, and that would solve the problem.  My brain is still pretty spacey today -- can we do this just by looking for \"universe = grid\" in the submit file?  If so, it's a pretty easy fix just in DAGMan...\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-29 13:50:50 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThe job submitted by DAGMan would still have the DAGManNodesLog attribute and events for the job would still be written. It's only in the new job submitted by the gridmanager where DAGManNodesLog is omitted. The new job isn't being monitored by DAGMan.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-29 14:23:25 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nOkay, that seems fine, then -- I thought the stripping off of the attribute would prevent DAGMan from seeing the events in the \"workflow log\".\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-02 16:03:02 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI verified that when a HTCondor-C job has dagman_log set, the DAGMan log contains entries only for the HTCondor-C job, and not the new job submitted by the c-gahp.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/685/condorc-daglog.patch\">condorc-daglog.patch</a>\n580 bytes added by jfrey on 2013-Feb-19 21:03:53 UTC.\n<br/>\nFix Condor-C jobs that have DAGManNodesLog set.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Apr-11 13:01</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/0fbb9ddd7fe1bcdb39ec2920aa02d36f58d95dc0\">[35378]</a></span>: better formatting of 7.9.6 version history item ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3474\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3474'); return false;\" title=\"DAGMan jobs and Condor-C\">#3474</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Apr-02 16:00</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/4f6ce198ce5663e163885c9a2ddf3541384ad108\">[35312]</a></span>: Version history for Condor-C DAGMan log bug. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3474\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3474'); return false;\" title=\"DAGMan jobs and Condor-C\">#3474</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Mar-29 11:02</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/1d0935b8d3af071cb6b3404ae6203549cca48cfd\">[35290]</a></span>: Remove DAGManNodesLog attribute from Condor-C jobs. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3474\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3474'); return false;\" title=\"DAGMan jobs and Condor-C\">#3474</a></span> This attribute specifies a log that job events should be written to.
