The machine uses ECC memory which hadn't caught a bit correction in the last two weeks. So bad stick of ram is unlikely.\n\n</p><p>What is more likely is a particular user or set of jobs caused the shadow to take a weird code path leading to the SIGILL. The logs are available in the associated rust ticket and they need datamining to figure out the common condition of the faulting shadows. For example, were they all from the same user or cluster?</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2015-Sep-21 11:38", "status": "defer", "created": "2009-Sep-25 14:10", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-25 14:10", "broken_version": "v070204", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "a19595", "customer_group": "ligo", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu,psilord@cs.wisc.edu,pcouvare@caltech.edu", "due_date": ""}
