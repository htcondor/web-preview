No objections were raised to the approach, although he asked me to verify that repeated condor_hold/condor_release on such jobs had predictable behavior.\n\n<p>Just did the testing this morning; there are no apparent issues in evicting the jobs multiple times.

Imagine a job that writes out a self-checkpoint and has transfer files ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT.  If <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SpoolOnEvict\" title=\"Spool On Evict\">SpoolOnEvict</a></span> is True (as it always has been), then checkpoint file is written to spool and the job will resume where it left off upon restart because files in spool are a) written atomically, and b) sent to the execute node on restart.  If a self-checkpointing job has <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SpoolOnEvict\" title=\"Spool On Evict\">SpoolOnEvict</a></span> set to False, what happens on restart?  This is what I wanted you to test...  my guess is the job will restart from the beginning, right?  If true, at the very least, the documentation should note that setting <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SpoolOnEvict\" title=\"Spool On Evict\">SpoolOnEvict</a></span> will prevent user level checkpoint/resume and is only intended for debugging purposes?\n\n<p>Re the question about keeping <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SpoolOnEvict\" title=\"Spool On Evict\">SpoolOnEvict</a></span> hidden or not - I'd vote for documenting it, but doing so in a way that clearly states the use case for this knob and what breaks/surprises are in store if you use it.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2014-Nov-04 13:36:07 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSee <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=4679\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('4679'); return false;\" title=\"Make SpoolOnEvict more useful\">#4679</a></span> for follow-on work to this.\n\n<p>As an aside, I am confused about why this ticket was moved (by TimT) from active to docpending without any of the code review changes being addressed, and then moved (by brian) from docpending to resolved without any documentation being added.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/828/gt4282.patch\">gt4282.patch</a>\n980 bytes added by bbockelm on 2014-Apr-02 02:22:13 UTC.\n<br/>\nMinimal patch for implementing <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=SpoolOnEvict\" title=\"Spool On Evict\">SpoolOnEvict</a></span>.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2014-May-22 11:14</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/164956036fb3887581720a0707a59922e7baec48\">[40214]</a></span>: edit new 8.1.6 version history item.
