{"id": 6884, "title": "Ticket #6884: Do not perform a network turnaround for each file transfer", "description": "<blockquote>\nTurns out that HTCondor's file transfer performs a network turnaround (roundtrip communication between shadow and starter) for each file transferred by File Transfer.  This is really unfortunate as it hurts network throughput due to i) latency (esp if submit and execute host are separated by the WAN), and ii) by preventing the TCP window from filling up, esp if many small files are being transferred.\n\n<p>Prior to any command sent by the file transfer object, the object will check to see if it needs a go-ahead from its peer.\n\n</p><p>The <code>condor_starter</code> gives a \"go-ahead always\", meaning that the shadow never again waits.  The <code>condor_shadow</code> gives a \"go-ahead once\", meaning the transfers between the shadow and starter requires a round trip between peers to finish.\n\n</p><p>If <code>condor_shadow</code> is configured to not limit transfers (<code>MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS=0</code> or <code>MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=0</code>), then it will always send a \"go-ahead always\" without acquiring a transfer token.  Additionally, the <code>condor_shadow</code> will send a \"go-ahead always\" after it has acquired the token <em>only if</em> <code>MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS=0</code>.  This appears to be dead code as, in this case, the shadow never acquires the token!\n\n</p><p>Currently, once a transfer token is received, the shadow <strong>never</strong> relinquishes it\u00a0and it does not appear to expire.  Accordingly, it appears the starter always requests a go-ahead and the shadow provides one unconditionally without contacting the schedd.\n\n</p><p>This setup appears to serve no purpose.  We should have the shadow send a \"go-ahead always\" once it gets the transfer token.  I believe this change is of minimal risk: if, in the future, we decide the token should be a lease (or go back to the \"go-ahead once\" behavior), the change is shadow-side only.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Jan-30 14:31:19 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nPerhaps this patch should be merged into v8.8?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2019-Jan-30 14:33:36 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nA backport wouldn't be a bad idea.
