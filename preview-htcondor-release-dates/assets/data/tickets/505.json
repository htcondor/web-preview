For instance, the onexit_hold_true test wants to see the test go into hold state.  Once in the hold state, the test is removed.  If the user log reports the job as aborted, the test returns success... but the aborted event handler never makes any check to that the job ever entered the held state!  This test would pass if the job was immediately aborted upon submission w/o ever entering the hold state.\n</li><li>The tests sleep for multiple seconds.  There is no need for tests to be sleeping --- it just makes our test suite run slow and non-deterministically (i.e. what if the load average on the execute machine is very high?).  How about having the test submit a job that immediately exits with a well known (and uncommon) exit code, and then have the policy expressions test on that?</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-May-25 09:14:51 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nWell, the above broken behavior re onexit policy expressions was tracked down to the patches applied in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=452\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('452'); return false;\" title=\"remote job in grid universe can be killed even after lease renewed\">#452</a></span>.\n\n<p>So the onexit expressions are not broken by default in shipped versions of Condor, and thus the priority of this ticket is not as high, nor are the tests as broken as the above makes out.\n\n</p><p>However, several of the comments above from an inspection of the tests still apply (the cut-n-pasted code, etc).
