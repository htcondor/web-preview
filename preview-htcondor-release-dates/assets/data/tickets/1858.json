The manual says: \"One machine should run the condor_dbmsd daemon. On this machine, add it to the DAEMON_LIST configuration variable. All Quill-enabled machines should also run the condor_quill daemon. The machine running the condor_dbmsd daemon can also run a condor_quill daemon.\"\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>The manual is probably not clear enough in this, and should say \"Only one machine\"\n\n</p><p></p><ol>\n<li>condor_q -direct quilld isn't supported any more - the Quill Daemon does not directly answer queries. It is pretty easy to argue that it's a bug that it is even accepted on the commandline any longer (However, in weird pool setups with new condor_q's and old (v6.8) condor_quill daemons, it would still work)</li></ol>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2011-Mar-03 14:08", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Jan-20 09:46", "fixed_version": "2011-Jan-20 09:46", "broken_version": "v070405", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
