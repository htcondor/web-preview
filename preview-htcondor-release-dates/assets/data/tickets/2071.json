{"id": 2071, "title": "Ticket #2071: Cross stduniv tests aren't flexible enough", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn a cross test scenario, it turns out that the stduniv tests are condor_compiled on the native host and submitted on the target host. It should really that each stduniv test should have available two executables, one condor_compiled on the native platform, and on condor_compiled on the target platform, and both used for a test.\n\n<p>Having it the way it does now minimizes the usefulness of cross tests of standard universe for compatibility testing.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Apr-25 16:48:24 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nMeh, doing exploratory hacking.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Apr-26 14:47:49 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nThis ticket is going to take a while to solve because I have to wait for 1.5+ hours for a build when run through NMI.
