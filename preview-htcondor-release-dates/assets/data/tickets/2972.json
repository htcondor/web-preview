{"id": 2972, "title": "Ticket #2972: Distribute example DAGs", "description": "<blockquote>\nI was just thinking about some of the discussions I had at Condor Week, it seems like there are a lot of cases where people aren't aware of a lot of the DAGMan functionality, or maybe are aware of it but don't know how to use it.  So I was thinking that maybe one way to address this would be to distribute (or put on the Wiki or something) various examples of DAGs using certain features of DAGMan.  I'm thinking of complete workflows that a user could download and run as-is to illustrate certain features of DAGMan.\n\n<p>I'm not sure about this, but it seems like at least in some cases some of the DAGs used in the automated tests could at least be starting points for this kind of thing.  (We wouldn't need the actual test framework, but the DAG files, submit files, etc. would be needed -- everything should be there so a user can do condor_submit_dag &lt;whatever&gt;.dag and have it work.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2012-May-04 14:09", "status": "new", "created": "2012-May-04 14:09", "fixed_version": "2012-May-04 14:09", "broken_version": "v070706", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
