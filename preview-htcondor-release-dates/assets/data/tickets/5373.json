{"id": 5373, "title": "Ticket #5373: Clean up DAGMan \"node ending\" code", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe code that deals with \"node ending\" events is getting more and more complicated and difficult to deal with.  For example, if there's some action you need to perform when a node is finished (whether successfully or unsuccessfully) including all retries, if any, there is no clear place to do this.  Things like testing whether we need to retry a node is done in a number of places, marking the node successful or unsuccessful is done in a number of places, etc.\n\n<p>I think that a lot of this problem is caused by the fact that some of this code dates from when things were much simpler (e.g., no pre/post scripts, no retries, no multi-proc nodes, no noop nodes, no maxidle, no DAG abort, etc.).\n\n</p><p>I'd like to see something like the following:\n</p><ul>\n<li>A method that's called every time one \"try\" of a node is finished.\n</li><li>A method that's called every time <strong>all</strong> \"tries\" of a node are finished.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Maybe some of the code that's now in the Dag class should get moved into the Job class.\n\n</p><p>Some of the methods that should get cleaned up:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Dag::PreScriptReaper()\n</li><li>Dag::TerminateJob()\n</li><li>Dag::RestartNode()\n</li><li>Dag::ProcessFailedSubmit()\n</li><li>Dag::ProcessAbortEvent()\n</li><li>Dag::ProcessTerminatedEvent()\n</li><li>Dag::ProcessJobProcEnd()\n</li><li>Dag::ProcessPostTermEvent()\n</li><li>Dag::ProcessSubmitEvent()</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Jan-03 15:24</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/fae9bb26f793bacf9c18999881e287a893da6608\">[49903]</a></span>: Gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"active\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6065\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6065'); return false;\" title=\"Last DAG status in dagman.out incorrect when final node overrides\">#6065</a></span>: Committing some extra test output; I may try to finish up <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"active\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5373\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5373'); return false;\" title='Clean up DAGMan \"node ending\" code'>#5373</a></span>: Clean up DAGMan \"node ending\" code before continuing with this...
