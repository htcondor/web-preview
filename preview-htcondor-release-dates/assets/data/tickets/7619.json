{"id": 7619, "title": "Ticket #7619: don't walk directory tree if output file transfer remaps not enabled", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe file transfer remap code calls itself recursively for each subdirectory, looking for things to remap.  There was a max depth of 20 (to avoid infinite recursion in case the user defined a cycle).  A user actually ran into this, so we bumped it to 128 in the stable series.  However, they weren't even using remaps; the code was just looking to apply an empty set of rules and recursively walking the whole directory tree.  We should just short circuit this whole process if the set of remaps is empty.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:21", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Apr-27 08:44", "fixed_version": "2020-Apr-27 08:44", "broken_version": "v080900", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "FileTransfer", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "#7581", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
