{"id": 3483, "title": "Ticket #3483: Microsecond time stamps in user log", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently the user log writes timestamps in one second granularity.  Several times, for peformance testing and debugging, I've wanted to see better granularity for these timestamps.  I've implemented this a couple of times, and thrown the code away, I'd just like to get it in the code now, #ifdef'ed out, so it is there when I need it the next time.  Don't want to break any log readers out there, so this will just be internal, for developer use.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Feb-05 11:52</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/4afe3434fbd4c059fb301fc001ee291c371fd894\">[34856]</a></span>: Optionally write microseconds to user log when ifdef'd in <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3483\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3483'); return false;\" title=\"Microsecond time stamps in user log\">#3483</a></span> off by default  (By Greg Thain )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Aug-04 12:11", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Feb-05 10:56", "fixed_version": "2013-Feb-05 10:56", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
