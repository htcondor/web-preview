Unfortunately, it languished in an old workspace, and I don't even remember the exact status of it.  I did a quick attempt to patch it in to a branch off the trunk, but ran into all kinds of conflicts; I'd guess that it'd take at least a couple of days.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jul-14 12:52:46 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nI've added a knob, START_HISTORY, which, if defined, tells the startd to write a job ad to this file name when the job leaves the machine for any reason.  It rotates the file in the same way the schedd did, with the same knobs, and obeys PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIRECTORY.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Jul-13 17:51</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/57b47adc4a398451294f54be3db08cf1a663f666\">[15066]</a></span>: Add <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=239\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('239'); return false;\" title=\"Add accounting information to the startd\">#239</a></span>, support for startds to write history files just like schedds Add new param STARTD_HISTORY, which controls if startds append to a job history file.
