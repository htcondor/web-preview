{"id": 5163, "title": "Ticket #5163: Buffer received messages from ReliSock", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, there's no buffering on the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ReliSock\" title=\"Reli Sock\">ReliSock</a></span> for <strong>receiving data</strong> (unlike sending data, which is buffered until 4KB or EOM).  Each thing coded on the socket (string, integer) is a separate call to recv() (and two fcntl and a poll).\n\n<p>This is especially obvious when receiving <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> updates (NOTE: during later investigation, it was revealed that the problematic case is qmgmt updates, not <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span>).  Each attribute in an ad requires two recv()'s, meaning each attribute is about 10 syscalls.\n\n</p><p>I think <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=RcvMsg\" title=\"Rcv Msg\">RcvMsg</a></span> should do a non-blocking read into a buffer; if there's insufficient bytes immediately available, then repeat the blocking read with precisely the number of bytes required.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jul-22 22:03:14 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nChatting with Jaime, there might be something more subtle here (we think that it does \"the right thing\" in many cases).  Maybe this only occurs when in non-blocking mode?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Aug-03 08:55:39 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nFound some time to poke around at this one -\n\n<p><span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAds\" title=\"Class Ads\">ClassAds</a></span> didn't seem to be the problem in the end.  Instead, it was a lot of the QMGMT commands (for example, condor_submit results in two recvfrom() syscalls per attribute; condor_shadow updates have a similar cost).\n\n</p><p>Enabling buffering in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ReliSock\" title=\"Reli Sock\">ReliSock</a></span> isn't too tricky - will push a branch soon.  The tricky part is the interplay between <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ReliSock\" title=\"Reli Sock\">ReliSock</a></span> and the Selector object; as the file descriptor no longer has bytes to read, it is no longer marked as ready by select.  Hence, any code touching ReliSock's must explicitly understand the buffered mode.\n\n</p><p>Accordingly, I left buffering off by default and only enabled it for DaemonCore-managed sockets and places where the socket has a short managed lifetime.  This will prevent such buffered sockets from leaking to places like the python bindings.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2015-Aug-03 08:42</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/75081d4a5e1ca6080ac8693464485ac562a629e1\">[45451]</a></span>: Allow <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ReliSock\" title=\"Reli Sock\">ReliSock</a></span> to buffer incoming data. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"review\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5163\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5163'); return false;\" title=\"Buffer received messages from ReliSock\">#5163</a></span> This adds a buffered mode to the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ReliSock\" title=\"Reli Sock\">ReliSock</a></span> (off by default) which keeps a 4KB buffer internal to the socket object itself.
