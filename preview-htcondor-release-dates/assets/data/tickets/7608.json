{"id": 7608, "title": "Ticket #7608: Explicitly list source file in condor_utils CMakeLists", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe CMakeLIsts in condor_utils forms a list of source for libcondorutil by globbing all the files in the condor_utils directory, minus a blacklist.  This requires developers to re-build cmake when a new file shows up, which they may not be aware of if it comes from someone else.\n\n<p>CMake best practice is to explicitly list all source files.\n\n</p><p>Also, all the source files in this directory are built twice -- once for the shared library version and once of the static version.  Making things worse, many of the files are built four times -- static and shared for both libcondorutils and libcondorapi.\n\n</p><p>This change will explicitly list the files that go in just condorapi, just condorutils or both, and compile each one just once.  As we already turn on -fPIC for all files, this should not be a problem.\n\n</p><p>Also, the same problem happens in the classad library, so we'll do the same trick there.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Jun-29 09:52:23 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nInternal change only, no release notes needed.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2020-Apr-19 22:59</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/e88b9a151fc181ff12d87d5e7b7f3981da37a3e5\">[59420]</a></span>: Explicitly list source files in condor_utils <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7608\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7608'); return false;\" title=\"Explicitly list source file in condor_utils CMakeLists\">#7608</a></span>  (By Greg Thain )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Jun-29 09:53", "status": "resolved", "created": "2020-Apr-19 22:56", "fixed_version": "2020-Apr-19 22:56", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
