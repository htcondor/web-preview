This is the wrong approach!!!  There is no need for the matchmaker to do anything \"smart\" re pslots to solve this problem.  There is no need for the matchmaker to even know about pslots period.  The last thing we need is yet more attempts for the negotiator to be \"smart\".  The whole idea is we don't want the matchmaker to match individual jobs against a pslot, we want the schedd to handle this level of detail.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jun-20 11:59:16 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\neje above wrote:\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nWith p-slots, this semantic breaks down: the default weight (number of cpus) doesn't represent a true cost of matching, since a job in reality peels off only some fraction of the p-slot's resources, and so in general it should not be charged the entire weight.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>I also disagree with the above statement.\n\n</p><p>If the matchmaker matches a pslot with 100cpus to a schedd, then 100 IS the true cost of the match - that entire pslot was delegated to that schedd, so it should pay.  When the next negotiation cycle happens, the accountant will see that (perhaps) the schedd only is really using 1 cpu out of the initial 100, and the charging will automatically adjust - just as if the schedd had 1 long running job and 99 1 second jobs.\n\n</p><p>Think of it this way: the matchmaker is not in the business of matching jobs to slots.  It is in the business of matching resource requests coming from schedds to slots.  The schedd says \"gimme a resource like this\", and the matchmaker gives it out.  What job, and even how many concurrent jobs, the schedd decides to run on this resource is up to the schedd.  The matchmaker should not know or care at this level.\n\n</p><p>Perhaps we should talk before you do anything on this ticket....\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jun-20 12:00:42 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nIs it possible for the negotiator to \"gift\" the submitter more resources than they ask?  In this case, we could increase the pie slice.\n\n<p>The tougher case is when there is contention for resources.  If we have 10 submitters with 10 jobs each and one resource with slot weight 100, who gets the resource?  This gets even stickier with respect to concurrency limits.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Jun-20 12:11:56 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nIf we have 10 submitters with 10 jobs each and one resource with slot weight 100...\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>Answer:  The submitter with the best user priority.

In a pool with p-slots of large weight, this scenario becomes more likely.\n\n</p><p>I consider this an argument for the notion that whatever object is doing the matching of jobs to resources needs to have access to centralized accounting of cc-limits and group quotas, and that same object needs to be responsible for parseling out p-slots.\n\n</p><p>Currently that object is the negotiator.  If that object ever becomes the scheduler, the current practice of supporting multiple schedulers on a pool raises issues of centralized accounting of quotas, cc-limits, resource usages, prios, etc.  It also seems a lot like making the scheduler into something that is nearly isomorphic to what we now call the matchmaker.\n</p><hr/>\n<em>2012-Aug-23 13:52:15 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070802 to v070803 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Sep-11 11:06:53 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070803 to v070804 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Sep-19 16:15:53 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070804 to v070805 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Oct-25 17:52:16 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070806 to v070807 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2012-Dec-19 09:30:47 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070807 to v070808 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2013-Mar-28 17:16:00 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070808 to v070809 using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2013-Mar-28 17:16", "status": "active", "created": "2012-May-28 15:12", "fixed_version": "2012-May-28 15:12", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "eje", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu, eje@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, gthain@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
