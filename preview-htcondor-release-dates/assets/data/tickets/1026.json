Is that really useful? Proposed: delete the attribute, probably replace with D_FULLDEBUG?\n\n</p><p>D_PREEMPT appears to be completely unused.\n\n</p><p>D_NFS is solely used in condor_syscall_lib/extern_path.c.

Can it be D_FULLDEBUG?</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Feb-01 10:37:25 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nD_KEYBOARD is useful because you'll get a ton of lines in the log every 5 seconds and eventually the whole log will be filled with that. It turns the log useless.\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Dec-21 14:24:40 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nZapped D_PREEMPT, keeping D_KEYBOARD on Pete's advice, leaving D_NFS for now.
