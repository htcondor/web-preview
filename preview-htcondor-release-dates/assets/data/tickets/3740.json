The hunt is on as to which...\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-03 11:50:54 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nLooks like condor got built with IPv6 support - but the gsoap external did not.\n\n<p>This is now fixed - soap_job_tests is passing on master.\n\n</p><p>TJ, can I backport this to 8.0?

However, it changes an existing external; we really should rev the external to 2.7.10-p6 to ensure we don't use older builds.  (This exact problem cause me some confusion.)\n\n<p>Also, this particular patch (or lack of a patch) is breaking proper builds on V7_8-branch?  Are you referring to <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3698\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3698'); return false;\" title=\"Proper gsoap crashes\">#3698</a></span>?  Or the combination of both?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-06 13:54:04 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nAlso, I believe this means SOAP was busted in 8.1.0. As such, this requires documentation as a bug fix in the version history.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Aug-12 16:10:11 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nThe test is probably still disabled and needs reenabling: if doing so isn't obvious, ask bt to do it.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Aug-03 11:46</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/c2890e0f3c36fb271cd7055273631b3877ad6e1b\">[37089]</a></span>: Make sure gsoap external is built with ipv6 support. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3740\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3740'); return false;\" title=\"Fix soap_job_tests on master\">#3740</a></span>  (By Brian Bockelman )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Aug-03 09:18</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/a75b727b937d680c92beea37471ec83cc933b891\">[37086]</a></span>: Make sure gsoap external is built with ipv6 support. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3740\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3740'); return false;\" title=\"Fix soap_job_tests on master\">#3740</a></span>  (By Brian Bockelman )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2014-Aug-08 13:33", "status": "resolved", "created": "2013-Jul-08 14:47", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-08 14:47", "broken_version": "v080100", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "adesmet@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
