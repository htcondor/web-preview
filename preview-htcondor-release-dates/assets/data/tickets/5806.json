{"id": 5806, "title": "Ticket #5806: Windows memory reporting incorrect (ImageSize_RAW, etc.)", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe are running HTCondor 8.4.8. We have a pool of:\n1) Linux (RHEL 7.2) central manager\n2) Windows 2012 R2 schedulers (soon to be RHEL 7.2)\n3) Windows 2012 R2 execute nodes\n\n<p>Memory reporting is incorrect. Jobs are all capped at reporting their memory usage at ~4.20 GBs. This is incorrect because the jobs shouldn't be using the same amount of memory, and also because logging onto the execute nodes shows that the processes are using much more. In some cases, jobs are using 30+ GBs of memory each. This is causing our nodes to run out of memory.\n\n</p><p>We are trying to implement policies to control memory usage, but because the memory reporting is incorrect, we're unable to catch and stop jobs using more than their allocation.\n\n</p><p>I will attach screenshots showing the output of condor_q as well as the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CycleServer\" title=\"Cycle Server\">CycleServer</a></span> GUI.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2016-Jul-26 14:13:28 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\ncondor_history output is garbled, condor_q output is missing.\nI can't tell from this that the problem isn't in cycle server.\n\n<p>I can see that much of HTCondor (starter AND shadow) uses 32 bit values to move the <code>ResidentSetSize</code> attribute around,  But since that these values are in K, the job would have to be using 4TB to overflow that.\n\n</p><p>I'd like to see what values are actually coming back from the procapi into the starter.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Jul-26 15:44:45 by rfutrick:</em> <br/>\n\nThanks for taking a look!\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no condor_q output, as the job is no longer in the queue. At this point I'm not even sure the job is in the history file anymore either.\n\n</p><p>As far as CS being the source of the problem, the incorrect memory totals were originally reported from condor_history output only. I used <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CycleServer\" title=\"Cycle Server\">CycleServer</a></span> as a way of easily verifying the issue, but also confirmed that condor_history returns the same results. CS rounds the value for display, but not in its internal store.\n\n</p><p>I did a dump of the ImageSize_RAW for all jobs in the history file, and none were using more that ~4.2 GBs. But we are definitely seeing a small number of machines occasionally run out of memory. They have &gt; 10 GBs per core, but the problem jobs report upwards of 30 GBs used if we log directly on to the execute node.\n\n</p><p>1) How can I get you the values that are actually coming back from the procapi into the starter?\n\n</p><p>2) Is there any other data can we provide?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2016-Aug-01 14:13:37 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\nIf you can catch it in the act, you could run the <code>procd_ctl</code> to see what the procd is reporting.
