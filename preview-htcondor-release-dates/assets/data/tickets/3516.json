As of macos\n        10.4, the default is 0. However, since an admin may configure their\n        machine to have a process utilize task_for_pid when it isn't running\n        as root, we allow the admin to tell Condor about this.\n\n        As for 09/05/2007 for macosx 10.3 &amp; 10.4, these are the\n        applicable values.\n\n        Old policy is:\n            - the caller is running as root (EUID 0)\n            - if the caller is running as the\n                same UID as the target (and the target's\n                EUID matches its RUID, that is, it's not\n                running a setuid binary)\n        New policy is:\n            - if the caller was running as root (EUID 0)\n            - if the pid is that of the caller\n            - if the caller is running as the same UID\n                as the target and the target's EUID matches\n                its RUID, that is, it's not a setuid binary\n                AND the caller is in group \"procmod\" or\n                \"procview\"\n\n                The long term goal of having both \"procmod\"\n                and \"procview\" is that task_for_pid would\n                return a send right for the task control\n                port only to those processes in \"procmod\";\n                the callers in \"procview\" would only get a\n                send right to a task inspection port.  This\n                distinction is not currently implemented.\n\n        To actually set the policy, do this:\n\n        $ sudo sysctl -w kern.tfp.policy=1 #set old policy\n        $ sudo sysctl -w kern.tfp.policy=2 #set new policy\n        $ sudo sysctl -w kern.tfp.policy=0 #disable task_for_pid except for root\n\n        Since I can't seem to find a man page for task_for_pid() *anywhere*,\n        which is odd, I'm going to declare that if it comes back not a\n        KERN_SUCCESS, then I don't have permission to see the pid. Sadly,\n        I can't tell if a pid is not there, or I don't have a permission\n        to see it using this method.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I'm just waiting for an account so I can inspect those settings and the procd logs.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Apr-26 12:52:15 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nthe above is interesting but not the problem here.  kern.tfp.policy is already set to \"2\" on the node i examined.  so there must be some other reason we are getting \"0\" from task_for_pid.  continuing to investigate.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-May-16 14:46:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nPid 0 is pseudo-process named \"kernel_task\" that represents the kernel. It doesn't show up in ps, but does show up in the Activity Monitor application. Since it's not a real process that can be manipulated, I propose we ignore it when building the full list of pids on the system.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-May-23 13:42</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/be498e8969bb6639a697408d5cc953e525b5e370\">[35844]</a></span>: Version history for pid 0 errors on mac. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3516\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3516'); return false;\" title=\"ProcLog on MacOSX shows error on startup.\">#3516</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-May-16 16:49</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/fd295513035aa32c97eb5cf637d9348608f18d84\">[35719]</a></span>: Ignore pid 0 in procapi on macosx. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3516\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3516'); return false;\" title=\"ProcLog on MacOSX shows error on startup.\">#3516</a></span> The full list of pids returned by sysctl() on MacOSX include pid 0, which is not a real userland process.
