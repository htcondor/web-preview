{"id": 3823, "title": "Ticket #3823: Use stale info in passwd_cache for a short period", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen an entry in the passwd_cache becomes stale, the next query about that user account results in consulting the OS, in case the information has changed. If the OS call fails, then the passwd_cache also returns failure.\n\n<p>We have seen a server at CERN where for a minute every day, queries to the OS about user accounts return \"no such account\", due we believe to maintenance on the local ldap server. If a Condor daemon looked up any user account during this time and the passwd_cache entry was stale, the daemon got a failure. This could lead to a job failing to run or the daemon exiting.\n\n</p><p>When a call to the OS about a user account fails and we have stale information in the passwd_cache, we could use that stale information for a short period of time. That would make Condor more resilient to short-lived ldap server failures.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Jul-29 17:26", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Jul-29 17:26", "fixed_version": "2013-Jul-29 17:26", "broken_version": "v070808", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#3723", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
