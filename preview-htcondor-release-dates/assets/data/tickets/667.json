{"id": 667, "title": "Ticket #667: Lazy log file code doesn't work correctly with DIR", "description": "<blockquote>\nJust found this in the course of working on the new \"default log file\" feature.  In at least some cases the new code doesn't seem to work right with nodes that have DIR specified.  I'm going to make a couple of tests and make sure they work with the old code, and then fix the new code.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nOkay, looks like I was wrong about this -- I ran into some errors that I thought were from the combination of the lazy log files code and DIR, but it looks like they're not.  Oh, well -- I added a couple of new tests (job_dagman_node_dir and job_dagman_usedagdir) to make sure things work.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2009-Dec-26 20:25", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-Aug-13 18:50", "fixed_version": "2009-Aug-13 18:50", "broken_version": "v070302", "priority": "1", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "wenger", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
