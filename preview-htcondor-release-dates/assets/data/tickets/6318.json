{"id": 6318, "title": "Ticket #6318: Update HTCondor-managed AFS creds when new jobs are submitted or run", "description": "<blockquote>\nAll of this is assuming you are using the SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY, SEC_CREDENTIAL_PRODUCER, CREDMON, etc. to manage creds (krb5 tickets, AFS tokens, whatever) for jobs.\n\n<p>Currently, when a job is submitted it sends a \"cred\" which is opaque to HTCondor to the credd before actually submitting the job.  If the credd already has a cred for that user stored in the SEC_CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY, it simply discards the new cred rather than update them.  Instead we should update them every X minutes.  We shouldn't update them every time, as then the CREDMON will likely make a fresh call to the KDC and the KDC could become overwhelmed.\n\n</p><p>Likewise, on the execute side, if a job from a user is about to run, and a cred for that user already exists, we currently don't bother updating it.  Again, if the existing credential is more than X minutes old, we should update it.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Jun-28 17:48:19 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nI'm proposing to add a configuration variable called SEC_CREDENTIAL_REFRESH_INTERVAL.\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>If it the value is negative, HTCondor will never update the credential if it already exists.
