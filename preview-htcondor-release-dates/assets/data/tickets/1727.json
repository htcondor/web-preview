{"id": 1727, "title": "Ticket #1727: Windows install does not add condor_kbdd to the DAEMON_LIST", "description": "<blockquote>\nMy desktop computer, dhanu, is running WinXP.  Last night it received some updates, including Condor.  This morning on login, I see a Windows Security Alert that Windows Firewall is blocking the condor_kbdd.  The condor_kbdd doesn't show up in my DAEMON_LIST.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Oct-28 08:42:09 by tstclair:</em> <br/>\n\nI believe this is normal for later versions because the kbdd is not started under master.  It's lauched as a user level service.  As far as the fw punch goes, I'm not 100% certain how the old installer &amp; master behaved if it wasn't in the DAEMON_LIST, Z would have to answer this.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-28 15:05:41 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nTJ and I already spoke to Becky about this.  Looking at the code, if the STARTD got added to DAEMON_LIST, then KBDD should also have been added.  But whether KBDD is part of DAEMON_LIST should be irrelevant to firewall punching, since that code checks to see if it is an execute node when it tries to figure out who to punch holes for.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-May-13 16:27:48 by ziliang:</em> <br/>\n\nResolved.  CSL maintains their own list of firewall exceptions for applications.  Whether we punched a hole or not was irrelevant.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Oct-19 10:57", "status": "resolved", "created": "2010-Oct-21 13:23", "fixed_version": "2010-Oct-21 13:23", "broken_version": "v070504", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Win32", "assigned_to": "ziliang", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bgietzel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tstclair@redhat.com, ziliang@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
