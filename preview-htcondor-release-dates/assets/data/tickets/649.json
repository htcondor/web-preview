{"id": 649, "title": "Ticket #649: new param() system should have patterns", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, the param default table specification file does not have the ability to specify patterns for when Condor code does param(\"%_LOG\") and such things.\n\n<p>I have a test piece of definition in which the actual layout of the patterns are defined.\n\n</p><p>The important thing to remember is that there are two classes of variables, patterned ones, and non-patterned ones. When param() does its deal, it should look into the hash of non-patterned entries first, then failing to find one, linearly search the pattern entries until a match is found. When a match is found, then specific string is associated to the pattern entry via memoization table. This will make the initial search linear, but later search use hash table complexity. This is an optimization, to be sure, but most likely a needed one immediately.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Mar-30 14:06", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Aug-03 11:16", "fixed_version": "2009-Aug-03 11:16", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#123", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
