{"id": 41, "title": "Ticket #41: WantParallelSchedulingGroup with fallback to ungrouped matching", "description": "<blockquote>\nAlan Woodland from condor-users (6 Dec 2008) brought up the question of how to use WantParallelSchedulingGroup=TRUE unless: more machines were requested than any one group can provide (at one time vs ever is a tricky distinction).\n\n<p>If <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=WantParallelSchedulingGroup\" title=\"Want Parallel Scheduling Group\">WantParallelSchedulingGroup</a></span> is an expression and match failure information is written to the job ad, this could be possible</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jan-20 14:49:14 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nThere's other stuff around <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=WantParallelSchedulingGroup\" title=\"Want Parallel Scheduling Group\">WantParallelSchedulingGroup</a></span>, too.  Some folks would like to have it be a \"Rank\", instead of requirements, so that parallel jobs would be steered to them if possible, but still run elsewhere.\n\n<p>It would be nice to have a single summary ad for each scheduling group, so that we'd match a single parallel job against the summarized ad.  This would make a lot of policies easier to implement and understand.\n</p><hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 15:59:08 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:21:33 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 14:49:30 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 14:49", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jan-17 08:27", "fixed_version": "2009-Jan-17 08:27", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "matt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
