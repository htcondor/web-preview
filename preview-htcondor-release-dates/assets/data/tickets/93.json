{"id": 93, "title": "Ticket #93: gridmanager's job polling near job completion can be improved", "description": "<blockquote>\nBNL was having a problem where jobmanagers were failing to send job DONE updates to the gahp. In the job RSL, the gridmanager sets the gram commit timeout to 10 minutes, so the jobmanager will wait that long for a reply to its DONE message before exiting. BNL had set the gridmanager\u2019s active job poll interval to 20 minutes, so by the time the gridmanager tried to poll the jobs\u2019 status, the jobmanagers were long gone.\n\n<p>The resulting error on the gridmanager\u2019s eventual poll attempt should cause it to attempt restarting the jobmanager. But it may be nice to catch the problem earlier by ensuring the commit timeout for the job is longer than the gridmanager\u2019s poll interval.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jun-17 14:18:58 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThis feature is already implemented by commit <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/36da7743b1d7c483f93191658f6dab669f795b00\">[10037]</a></span>.
