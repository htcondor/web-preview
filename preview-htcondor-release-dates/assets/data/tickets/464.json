{"id": 464, "title": "Ticket #464: Multifacet: RANK doesn't work", "description": "<blockquote>\nMultifacet users occasionally observe that non-multifacet users are using multifacet resources (clover, s1, s0).  This is okay, but multifacet users should have exclusive priority, implemented via RANK.  pfc decided RANK was broken and simple set START to limit the multifacet machines to multifacet users.  This was the status quo for several years.  gthain has decided RANK does work and turned it back on, probably late 2008.  Multifacet users are again seeing unexpected behavior.\n\n<p>In all of the cases gthain has investigated, condor_q -better-analyze has revealed that the user's jobs cannot match the machine the user wants.  Thus, it's not a RANK problem, it's a user job problem.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nadesmet 20091217: All cases appear to be user error.
