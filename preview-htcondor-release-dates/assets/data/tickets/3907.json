{"id": 3907, "title": "Ticket #3907: Improve handling of request_memory and vm_memory", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn my VM universe submit file, I specify vm_memory to set the memory size of my VM guest:\n\n<p>vm_memory = 2048\n\n</p><p>I do not specify a request_memory, because I do not know what it should be, given the vm_memory. I assume that there is some overhead associated with running the VM guest, but I have no way of knowing how much. Further, the job logs from my runs have no value for memory usage, so I cannot use historical information as a guide.\n\n</p><p>However, because I omitted request_memory from my submit file, I get these warnings upon submit:\n\n</p><p>NOTE: 'RequestMemory' was NOT specified.  Using JobVMMemory = 2048.<br/>\n\n.<br/>\n\nNOTE: 'RequestMemory' was NOT specified.  Using JobVMMemory = 2048.<br/>\n\n.<br/>\n\nNOTE: 'RequestMemory' was NOT specified.  Using JobVMMemory = 2048.<br/>\n\n.\n\n</p><p>After discussion with Jaime and TJ, they said that HTCondor could do better than emitting this warning. Some possibilities include (a) dropping the warning, since HTCondor is providing no actionable information to the user, or (b) doing something smart to set request_memory based on vm_memory (and probably, other background information that we glean on our own).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Sep-11 15:49", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Sep-11 15:47", "fixed_version": "2013-Sep-11 15:47", "broken_version": "v080002", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "VM", "assigned_to": "johnkn", "derived_from": "", "creator": "cat", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "cat@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
