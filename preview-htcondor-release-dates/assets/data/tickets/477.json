If that is overkill, a command line tool, which can show the number of jobs submitted in the last 10 minutes, or 1 hour etc, and their status, is certainly desirable.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Jul-16 10:23:21 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nA collector is now running at nostos.cs.wisc.edu:9619 for ads from BNL submit hosts.

A fix has been made for future Condor releases. In the mean time, BNL's submit machines are currently using CONDOR_VIEW_HOST to forward the ads to the Wisconsin collector.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:16", "status": "resolved", "created": "2009-May-11 12:07", "fixed_version": "2009-May-11 12:07", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Grid", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "#474", "creator": "tannenba", "rust": "", "customer_group": "atlas", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
