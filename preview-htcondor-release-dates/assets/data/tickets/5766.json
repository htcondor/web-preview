Some of the columns spacing is too large when it doesn't need to be.\n\n<p>1) condor_q -io spacing is too large for columns INPUT, OUTPUT when the data is actually small. This also results in the next columns (RATE and MISC) got eliminated.\n\n</p><p>2) condor_q -batch spacing is too small. When testing on batlab, column OWNER and JOB_IDS do not show properly.
