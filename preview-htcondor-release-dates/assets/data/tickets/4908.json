{"id": 4908, "title": "Ticket #4908: EventLog lock contention", "description": "<blockquote>\nCMS has noticed a high level of contention for the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=EventLog\" title=\"Event Log\">EventLog</a></span> lock (we had one schedd which stalled for &gt;5 minutes, which led to the master nuking the process), which led me to poke at the schedd via strace.  A few things that could be cleaned up:\n<ul>\n<li>The event and the corresponding \"job ad information\" are written under separate locks - meaning that a separate event entry could be logged between the two.\n</li><li>Under high contention, the lock deletion code becomes a mess as it tries to obtain the lock in order to delete it.  I observed multiple processes racing in the deletion code - meaning a given process may recreate the lock several times in order to obtain (and delete) it.  :(\n</li><li>I can't see any reason why O_APPEND can't be used here.  The FILE * buffers the events so only one write() call is done on fflush.  I wouldn't want to depend on that for correctness in all cases, but it would be nice to be able to make the tradeoff.  Perhaps O_APPEND is used if EVENT_LOG_LOCKING=false.\n</li><li>We really don't care about job ad updates - we wanted to use the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=EventLog\" title=\"Event Log\">EventLog</a></span> for forensics (what got run where).  I don't see a mechanism for doing that - would be useful.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Feb-23 11:09:10 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nAt first blush, I very much like the idea of giving the event log writing code the \"dprintf\" treatment such that a lock is only required on rotation iff the config file disables event log writing, and then set the param table to disable event log locking by default. This change should be at the lower level of the event writing code so we impact not only the schedd event log, but all event log writes (i.e. job event log, dagman event log).  We should be sure that any daemon (except perhaps dagman itself? ie limit it to schedd/shadows that have condor access?) that gets the lock is able to do the rotation, and also investigate the mess surrounding removing the lock file.\n\n<p>Setting to v080304 and assigning to Jaime (since he did the coding for the dprintf log treatment).\n\n</p><p>Not directly related, and should be a separate ticket, but also thinking about the event logs, I am thinking about disabling fsync by default on job and schedd event logs (but keeping it enabled by default on dagman event logs), and also about a way to keep the dagman event logs on an ssd. Ie a knobs like SPOOL=path and SPOOL_HIGH_SPEED=path, and SPOOL_HIGH_SPEED would store just the job_queue.log and DAGMan event log files by default.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Mar-04 14:03:35 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI have implemented the following changes for 8.3.5:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>Each event is written with a single write() syscall. This makes it safe to turn off locking of the user log and event log. This doesn't affect the rotation lock for the event log.\n</li><li>For rotation of the event log, the lock file is always a long-lived, explicitly named file, in the LOCK directory by default. This eliminates the need for the schedd to acquire the lock and delete the file every time it writes an event.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>In a future release, we will make non-locked writing the default.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Apr-07 08:54:17 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nRe-opening due to noticing a bug (before 8.3.5 release).\n\n<p>This fails because DAGMan does not have permission to lock the file.

It's not used at all for writing to the user job log or DAGMan log.
