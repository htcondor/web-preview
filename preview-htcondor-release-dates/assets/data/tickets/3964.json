However it was vague if a core file or EOROR caused us to fail test.\n\n</p><p><strong class=\"two\">Now</strong>\n\n</p><p>We still save the core files but have a build in limit(currently 10) set near the top of CondorTest.pm in $MAX_CORES. Once we see a core, we search all the daemon logs for the stack dump. We place this in the test output along with the c++filt output if that program exists. We also show part of our log of ERROR and CORE issues to stdout for the test.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Oct-03 11:05</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/c53648047d03de8f45fd575edc13a4a899a883ef\">[37755]</a></span>: Improve CORE file and ERROR handling <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3964\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3964'); return false;\" title=\"CORE and ERROR handling improvements in test infrastructure\">#3964</a></span>  (By Bill Taylor )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2013-Oct-03 11:41", "status": "new", "created": "2013-Oct-03 11:02", "fixed_version": "2013-Oct-03 11:02", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "bt", "derived_from": "#3594", "creator": "bt", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "johnkn@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
