{"id": 6803, "title": "Ticket #6803: pytest should have config editing and per-daemon on/off/restart", "description": "<blockquote>\nIt would benefit <code>cmd_now.run</code>, and probably others in the future, if the pytest module provided a way to stop a daemon, edit the configuration, and restart the daemon.  This shouldn't have to change the existing API or work-flow, but we'll want to be careful about the precise semantics of \"edit the configuration\"; regenerating from a new set of arguments and replacing the old configuration file(s) may be a good approach.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:46:13 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080906 to v080907 using ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 10:53", "status": "new", "created": "2018-Oct-24 14:02", "fixed_version": "2018-Oct-24 14:02", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
