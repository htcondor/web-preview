{"id": 1092, "title": "Ticket #1092: Git update hook to disallow development code in stable branches", "description": "<blockquote>\nOn two recent occasions (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1089\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1089'); return false;\" title=\"Revert bad merges into V7_4-branch\">#1089</a></span>, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1091\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1091'); return false;\" title=\"undo bad rebase of V7_4-branch\">#1091</a></span>), a significant amount of development code on the master branch was merged into <code>V7_4-branch</code>. This is bad for several reasons. To help prevent this from happening in the future, we should add an <code>update</code> hook in our main git repository that rejects pushes that introduce commits from the <code>master</code> branch into any stable branch. Cherry-picking of individual commits should still be allowed.\n\n<p>The <code>update</code> hook can work as follows. If a branch head is being moved (not created or deleted) and the branch name indicates it's a stable branch (i.e. '=Vx_y...=' where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are numbers and <code>y</code> is even), then perform the following check: Produce a list of SHA1s that are on <code>master</code> but not on the stable branch, and a list of SHA1s that the push is adding to the stable branch. If these two lists contain any common elements, reject the push.\n\n</p><p>Cherry-picking commits from <code>master</code> to a stable branch would be allowed, since the new commits have new SHA1s. Branch creation is always allowed, so creating a new stable series branch off of <code>master</code> would work fine.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Jan-07 10:30:25 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nI've attached the proposed update hook script.
