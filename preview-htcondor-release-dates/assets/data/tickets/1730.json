{"id": 1730, "title": "Ticket #1730: batlab<->cross test integration tool", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe need a tool which would take the current database of SubmitInfo.pm and a query of the batlab collector, and produce the difference list between what SubmitInfo.pm has in it and the machines actually available in the batlab--taking the cross tests into consideration. That would make it VERY easy to keep them in sync.\n\n<p>At this time, the batlab figures out by hand which native platforms work where, but that information is never propogated back to the SubmitInfo.pm file. It is\na decent pain in the butt to perform this set difference by hand.\n\n</p><p>I reckon SubmitInfo.pm itself could do this query, since it is already a perl\nscript.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2010-Oct-22 16:38", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Oct-22 16:37", "fixed_version": "2010-Oct-22 16:37", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "batlab", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu bgietzel@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
