{"id": 2717, "title": "Ticket #2717: transfer_input_files doesn't follow directory symlinks", "description": "<blockquote>\na merge of a bug fix for <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2387\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2387'); return false;\" title=\"transfer_input_files doesn't transfer directories on Windows.\">#2387</a></span> from 7.6.5 to 7.7.3 ended up making it so that transfer_input_files doesn't follow symlinks.  This happened because in the stable series the function that follows symlinks is safe_open_wrapper, but in developer branch, that function is now called safe_open_wrapper_follow.  Thus a merge from 7.6.5 that changed the line with the safe_open call ended up changing it from a symlink following call to one that didn't follow links.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Dec-15 10:09</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/bfe1a64f871721ee6b124dd9ab297134a39ea785\">[28797]</a></span>: fix safe_open_wrapper call in submit to use the new link-following version safe_open_wrapper_follow.
