Of course, this is something we should be testing in Condor's nightlies as well.\n\n<p>I have a test nearly ready to go, it just needs a bit more debugging love.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Jan-26 12:11:46 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nAll coding for this ticket done thus far is sitting in V7_3-procd_test-branch.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Feb-23 13:25:23 by gquinn:</em> <br/>\n\nA ProcD test program has been checked into the master. Its Python source files are in the src/condor_procd directory. The test relies on a new tool called procd_ctl which provides a command line interface for sending commands to the ProcD.\n\n<p>Comments in the test's source files give a decent overview of how to run the test. Start with procd_test_controller.py, which is the test's top-level file.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2009-Feb-23 13:16</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/9e3bf260b7ac5e75a9bb810911b40cfb356be532\">[13951]</a></span>: Add test program for the ProcD Note that some previous work for this was done on the branch V7_3-procd_test-branch.
