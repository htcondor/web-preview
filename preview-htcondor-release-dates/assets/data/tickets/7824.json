In general, exception don't need to be *Error... though I don't think there are really better names for most of these. One could argue between HTCondorLocateError and e.g. <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=FailedToLocateDaemon\" title=\"Failed To Locate Daemon\">FailedToLocateDaemon</a></span>; I don't think it matters much.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Other ideas:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>Add one or more THROW_EX() variants (possibly exception-specific) to make it easier to create exceptions with more data members (e.g., errno).  This of course implies adding data members to the exceptions.\n</li><li>THROW_EX_FORMAT()\n</li><li>THROW_EX_WITH_ERRNO()?</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-Nov-09 12:06", "status": "new", "created": "2020-Aug-27 12:21", "fixed_version": "2020-Aug-27 12:21", "broken_version": "v080909", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "#6935", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu, karpel@wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
