{"id": 1883, "title": "Ticket #1883: Improve the process of running jobs within parrot", "description": "<blockquote>\nNow that condor can run jobs within parrot, there are a few general improvements that should be made to improve the overall process.\n<ul>\n<li>Get the correct exit code from running job. Currently the exit code of parrot is indistinguishable from the job's exit code. The current plan is to do something similar to the java universe. This will require adding some functionality to parrot too.\n</li><li>Have machines advertise whether they have parrot enabled.\n</li><li>Allow arguments to parrot. This is easy to implement, but we still need to think about what arguments users and admins may want from parrot.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:20:02 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/269/diff\">diff</a>\n5499 bytes added by slauson on 2011-Feb-03 15:53:33 UTC.\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 12:36", "status": "active", "created": "2011-Jan-28 16:02", "fixed_version": "2011-Jan-28 16:02", "broken_version": "v070500", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "slauson", "derived_from": "#1628", "creator": "slauson", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "gthain@cs.wisc.edu jslauson@wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
