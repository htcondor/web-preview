Changes for version 0.9.6:  (released 07-Oct-2004)
* Can optionally use PCRE for the regexp() ClassAd function. On Unix,
  specify --use-pcre <dir>. We have tested with PCRE 4.5 and 5.0. 

* Added ClassAd functions: splitTime(), formatTime(), and random()

* Added ClassAd functions strcmp() and stricmp().

* Renamed the little used function isMember to identicalMember().

* Fixed bugs in the internal representation of times.

* Added classad_functional_tester, which is a significantly better
  than the old test_classads. 

* Added classad_unit_tester, which does lower-level tests than
  classad_functional_tester. This test program is incomplete, but well
  on its way. 

* Remove test_classads.

* Added classad_version program, which reports the version. 

* Fixed bugs in ExprList that were exposed by classad_unit_tester

* Fixed ClassAd functions real() and string() to work correctly. 

* Fixed bugs in XML parsing.

* Fixed a bug where the parser would choke on any input ending in a quotation
  mark because the lexer wasn't consuming the entire string token.

* Fixed a bug where the lexer would choke on any string ending in a backslash.
  Now it will only choke if the string ends in an odd number of backslashes. 

* Fixed bug that sometimes caused Flatten() to return an expression
  with a bad pointer.

* operator<<() now takes any ExprTree instead of just a ClassAd.

* Fixed a bug in the configure script that caused inappropriate
  parsing of arguments.

* Fixed numerous little bugs.
