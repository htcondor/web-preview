Any files which are held open by a process at checkpoint time should
be re-opened with the same ``attributes'' at restart time.  The
attributes of an open file include its file descriptor number, the
mode in which it is opened, (e.g. read, write, or read-write), the
offset to which it is positioned, and whether or not it is a duplicate
of another file descriptor.  Since much of this information is not
made available to user code by the kernel, we record several
attributes at the time the file descriptor is created via an <TT>
open()</TT> or <TT>dup()</TT> system call.  Information recorded includes the
pathname of the file, the file descriptor number, the mode, and (if it
is a dup) the base file descriptor number.  The offset to which the
file is positioned is captured at checkpoint time by use of the <TT>
lseek()</TT> system call.  All of this information is kept in a table in
the process's data space, which is of course restored early in the
restart process.  Later in the restart process, we walk through the
table and re-open and re-position all the files as they were at
checkpoint time.  Of course an important part of a file's state is its
content - we assume that that this is stored safely in the file
system, and that nobody tampers with it between checkpoint and restart
times.
