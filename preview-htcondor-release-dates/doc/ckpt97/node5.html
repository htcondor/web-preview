The stack is that part of the address space allocated at run time to
accommodate the information needed by the procedure call mechanism,
procedure call arguments, and automatic variables and arrays.  The
size of the stack varies at run time whenever a procedure is entered
or exited.  On some systems the stack begins at a fixed address near
the top of virtual memory and grows toward lower addresses, while on
others it begins at an address in the middle of virtual memory (to
allow space for heap allocation), and grows toward higher numbered
addresses.  Special care is taken to detect if the stack resides in
the data area (for example, if a user-level threads package is in use
by the program) and to locate all stack frames successfully if in this
case.  In any case, the stack can be written to a file provided only
that one knows its beginning and ending addresses.  Restoring the
stack requires a bit more of a trick.  The problem is that if the
saved stack information were to overwrite the call frame of the
procedure doing the restart, not only its local variables but also all
information regarding what to do at the conclusion of this procedure
would be lost.  To avoid this, we use a pre-defined area in the data
space as a temporary stack when executing that part of the restart
code which restores the stack.
