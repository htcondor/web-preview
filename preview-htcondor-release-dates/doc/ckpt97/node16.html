<P>
While the designers of truly distributed operating systems such as
Sprite and V Kernel have carefully defined and implemented their
process models to accommodate migration, we users of UNIX are not so
fortunate.  There are a lot of details in a process's state which are
implicit, known only to the kernel, or are otherwise difficult or
impossible to re-create.  In condor we have taken the viewpoint that
we can save and restore enough of a process's state to accommodate the
needs of a wide variety of real-world user code.  There is however, no
way we can save all the state necessary for every kind of process.
The most glaring lack of course is our inability to migrate one or
more members of a set of communicating processes.  In fact no attempt
is made to deal with processes which execute <TT>fork()</TT> or <TT>
exec()</TT>, or communicate with other processes via signals, sockets,
pipes, files, or any other means.  This is not to say that some
inventive users have not found ways to use Condor for communicating
processes, but they have changed their code to accommodate our
limitations.
<P>
Another major limitation is the fact the the condor checkpointing code
must be linked in with the user's code.  This is fine for folks who
build and run their own software, but it doesn't work for users of
third party software who don't have access to the source.  We have
considered schemes to provide a ``checkpointing C library'' for third
party programs which are dynamically linked, but so far have not
implemented anything.  A major obstacle to such work is the fact that
shared library implementations vary widely across platforms, and such
a facility would not be very portable.
