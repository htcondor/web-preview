There's no guarantee the sysadmin isn't also invoking iptables.  Alternately, the process with the lock may have gone to sleep indefinitely due to some unknown bug.\n\n</p><p><strong>Probably</strong> what we should do is some sort of opportunistic locking approach - try doing a lock.  After 1s, switch to the exponential backoff algorithm.\n\n</p><p>It's going to be fairly miserable to have a well-designed interface for the admin setup/cleanup scripts.  Probably no sysadmin is ready for this sort of behavior - no one does concurrent iptables I suspect, so no one is ready for things to fail due to this reason.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2013-Jan-09 19:46:23 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nThe locking code seems to have been mostly a matter of a wrong locking flag (FD_SETLK versus FD_SETLKW).\n\n<p>Once that's fixed, the next problem is the firewall cleanup code.  Since the iptables rules for bridge mode are pretty trivial, that may not be such a big issue for the demo.  Definitely an issue for the NAT code.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Jan-09 19:20</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/28fce4cf9b7bb3af1960aa98d470d2ef88e32eb7\">[46447]</a></span>: Use correct flag for locks; handle EINTR case. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3422\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3422'); return false;\" title=\"Fix locking code\">#3422</a></span>.
