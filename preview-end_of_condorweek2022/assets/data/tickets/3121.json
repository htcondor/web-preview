{"id": 3121, "title": "Ticket #3121: Job attribute Nonessential needs to be documented", "description": "<blockquote>\nFrom Todd T, posting on condor-users on 6/20/2012:\n\n<p> Do you always want to simply remove held grid jobs?\n\n</p><p> If so, you can put the following into the submit file of a grid universe\n job:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>     +nonessential = true\n</pre>\n\n<p> This tells Condor to simply abort (remove) any problematic job instead\n of putting the job on hold.  Condor will try to remove it nicely, but\n will not let it stick around in the queue even if it fails to confirm\n what happened on the execute node.  So placing the nonessential\n attribute in the job ad is equal to doing condor_rm followed by\n condor_rm -forcex anytime the job would have otherwise gone on hold.\n\n</p><p>Just for the record: to clarify, the nonessential attribute is only honored for jobs submitted into the grid universe (any gridtype).  It does not work for vanilla universe, but if folks would like to see it there as well we could add it to our list...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2013-Mar-07 10:29</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/71daf8cac6e93da5d56b9a5e5dc15340d6150a72\">[35090]</a></span>: Document grid-job-relevant job <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClassAd\" title=\"Class Ad\">ClassAd</a></span> attribute Nonessential ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3121\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3121'); return false;\" title=\"Job attribute Nonessential needs to be documented\">#3121</a></span>  (By Karen Miller )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2013-Mar-07 10:31", "status": "resolved", "created": "2012-Jul-11 11:26", "fixed_version": "2012-Jul-11 11:26", "broken_version": "v070800", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "smoler", "derived_from": "", "creator": "smoler", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
