{"id": 4481, "title": "Ticket #4481: Add a STARTD authorization for the schedd", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen MATCH auth fails (reasons not yet determined) for the startd's RELEASE_CLAIM, the CMS pool is currently seeing startds fall back to GSI.  However, this is not configured to work (and we don't want GSI used for any reason between schedd and startd).\n\n<p>We would remove GSI from the list of allowable READ authentication methods; however, CMS actually needs this for secure queries from the frontend.\n\n</p><p>I think the underlying issue is that the authorization needed for the STARTD is conflated with READ authorization (probably just convenient for the original implementation).  We should separate the two.\n\n</p><p>Without this, there's no obvious way to prevent the startd from using GSI on our schedds.  We cannot remove GSI from the startd itself because it is used to talk to the collector.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2014-Jul-22 15:58", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Jul-22 15:58", "fixed_version": "2014-Jul-22 15:58", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "isfiligoi@ucsd.edu", "due_date": ""}
