{"id": 7351, "title": "Ticket #7351: Add priority to yum repos", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe YUM \"priorities\" plugin allows packages from one repo to be preferred over packages from other repos.  Without the plugin, or between repos of equal priority, the highest version of an RPM gets picked when installing.  With the plugin, the highest version of an RPM from the repo with the best priority gets picked when installing.  Repos that don't have a priority defined have an effective priority of 100.\n\n<p>At OSG, we use priorities to make sure our RPMs get picked over OS RPMs of the same name, to ensure users get our patches.  Unfortunately, because the HTCondor YUM repos don't have priorities defined, the OSG packages get picked instead of the UW HTCondor RPMs when installing condor.\n\n</p><p>This is not what users want: when they explicitly install the UW HTCondor repos, they expect the UW HTCondor packages to be picked.  This can also cause weird installation failures.  Users generally solve this by hand-editing their htcondor repo files to define the priority for them.\n\n</p><p>It would be nice if the UW HTCondor repos had a priority in them that was better than the OSG priority.  To do this, add the line\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    priority=90\n</pre>\n\n<p>to each repo definition in the htcondor repo files.  (OSG's priority is 98 and lower is better.)</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nDone</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2019-Nov-15 16:19", "status": "resolved", "created": "2019-Oct-30 10:23", "fixed_version": "2019-Oct-30 10:23", "broken_version": "v080000", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "matyas", "rust": "", "customer_group": "osg", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matyas@cs.wisc.edu blin@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
