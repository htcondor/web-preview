What is the recipe for reproducing this?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-01 09:48:55 by dharris:</em> <br/>\n\nThe setup we are using in an all windows (XP/vista/server 2008) setup. About 28 CPU's.\n\n<p>The problem occurs when we submit a series of jobs (about 30) that all take the same amount of time to execute (about 10 minutes each).\n\n</p><p>Each jobs writes to a shared log file so that we can utilize condor_wait for our automation purposes.\n\n</p><p>What appears to happen is that sometimes a shadow ignores the lock (or fails to lock) the log file and the file gets garbled and condor_wait will wait forever. This happens with \"job executing on host\" and \"job completed\" messages occur at the same time as well as \"job size updated\", or so it seems.\n\n</p><p>Unfortunately we cannot consistently recreate this issue as it seems to be luck of the draw when messages get written to the log file.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-02 06:42:20 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this also broke DAGMan on Windows.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-02 06:53:03 by dharris:</em> <br/>\n\nI will DAGMan today and see if it has an issue as well\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-02 08:57:46 by nleroy:</em> <br/>\n\nDo you have a <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ShadowLog\" title=\"Shadow Log\">ShadowLog</a></span> and <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ScheddLog\" title=\"Schedd Log\">ScheddLog</a></span> from a window in which this occurred?

Sorry for the delay.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-19 16:42:13 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\ni believe the problem is now understood.  on windows, files are locked using a kernel mutex where the filename is name of the mutex.  however, if relative paths are involved, this can lead to two different names for the same file.  example partial submit file:\n<div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>initial_dir = c:\\path\\to\\subdir_foo\nlog = ..\\common.log\nqueue\n\ninitial_dir = c:\\path\\to\\subdir_bar\nqueue\n</pre></div>\n\nin both cases, the actual log file is c:\\path\\to\\common.log.  however, two differently named mutexes are used to \"lock\" the file because condor simply takes initial_dir and concats a forward slash and the log filename (in classad_helpers.cpp:getPathToUserLog).\n\n<p>suggested fix:  call realdir(), GetFullPathName(), or something along those lines before grabbing the mutex to ensure that different references to the same file end up using the same mutex.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-19 16:44:58 by dharris:</em> <br/>\n\nThat explanation makes sense with regards to our setup.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2009-Oct-20 15:45:47 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nPatch afc161be5e4564b1bafc5f82bb6c6fffcfeeacd4 causes the test suite to fail to build.
