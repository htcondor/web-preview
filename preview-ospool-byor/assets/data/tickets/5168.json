{"id": 5168, "title": "Ticket #5168: Increase rate of schedd job completion", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe have some schedds where the average job finish rate is greater than the duty cycle rate.  This results in an accumulation of jobs in 'C' state - more than 100k in one case.\n\n<p>As there are lots of unnecessary ads in the queue, queue scanning and hash table operations take longer - resulting in a longer duty cycle and more jobs in queue.\n\n</p><p>We should expose a knob to manage the number of completions done per duty cycle</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2015-Jul-28 08:02:55 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nJust to follow up -\n\n<p>This has been a complete lifesaver within CMS.  We found that our schedds could sustain a higher rate of \"real job completion\" (i.e., shadow finished the job) than they could sustain removing the proc from the queue.\n\n</p><p>We observed multiple cases over the past two weeks that were only solvable by this patch (or by having an operator log in and setting MAX_JOBS_RUNNING=0 and waiting until the issue has resolved).  On nodes with the patch applied, this issue has not returned.\n\n</p><p>I see no reason why someone would want to tune this knob; hence, I am not creating a param table entry.\n\n</p><p>Jaime, can you review?\n\n</p><p>Brian\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jul-28 09:30:02 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>I'm hesitant to increase the default count-per-interval setting of job_is_finished_queue to 8 without additional changes. Several jobs that have spool directories with a large number of files could block the schedd for a prolonged period. I'd like to see the addition of a time-based limit or make spool directory cleanup less of a synchronous operation.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jul-28 14:03:08 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nWhat about just waiting to merge until after <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5152\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5152'); return false;\" title=\"Perform spool removal out-of-process\">#5152</a></span>?\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2015-Jul-28 16:08:28 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nThat depends on how <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5152\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5152'); return false;\" title=\"Perform spool removal out-of-process\">#5152</a></span> is implemented.
