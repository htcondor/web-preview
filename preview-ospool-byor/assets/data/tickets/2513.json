However, this code caches the result of my_sin_addr(), among other things.  The problem with caching the result is that if my_sin_addr() is called before the configuration has been fully initialized, NETWORK_INTERFACE is not taken into account.  init_local_hostname() is called early during configuration in order to fill in config macros such as HOSTNAME.  From then on, the cached value is used, so NETWORK_INTERFACE is effectively ignored.\n\n</p><p>Note that all cached values in my_hostname.cpp are cleared and re-initialized by the config system after the configuration has been loaded.  Something similar needs to be done for the new IPv6 code, or it just needs to avoid caching.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Sep-30 12:52</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/dad843d03d769f2270f033257c4e73e120b6c6f8\">[27551]</a></span>: Documented fix for NETWORK_INTERFACE. ===GT=== <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2513\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2513'); return false;\" title=\"NETWORK_INTERFACE does not work as expected\">#2513</a></span> ===VersionHistory:Complete===  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Sep-30 12:51</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/225b619ad37f0a35f796498e5452c0c43206de8b\">[27550]</a></span>: NETWORK_INTERFACE was broken since 7.7.0. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2513\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2513'); return false;\" title=\"NETWORK_INTERFACE does not work as expected\">#2513</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2011-Oct-17 18:59", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Sep-30 11:12", "fixed_version": "2011-Sep-30 11:12", "broken_version": "v070700", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "danb", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
