description: |
  HTCondor is a software system that creates a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) environment. It
  effectively uses the computing power of machines connected over a network, be they a single
  cluster, a set of clusters on a campus, cloud resources either standalone or temporarily
  joined to a local cluster, or international grids. Power comes from the ability to effectively
  harness shared resources with distributed ownership.
