Let's catch these earlier\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>Some OpenSSL code only triggered on non-PROPER builds (where we <code>dlopen</code> the security libraries).  TODO: Add Fedora 28 / non-PROPER build.\n</li><li>Mac OS X 10.10 failed due to a missing OpenSSL flag which is <em>not</em> present in OpenSSL 0.9.8.  TODO: Determine if we want to continue support for this.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Jun-03 15:57:08 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nFor now, it appears that Travis-CI can support both of the missing platforms.  I did a trivial change so Travis should break if either OpenSSL 0.9.8 or 1.1.0 fails.\n\n<p>The Travis support for Mac OS X 10.10 is going to be very time-limited: these builds warn that the support was scheduled to be removed 1 January 2019.  I think those are living on borrowed time!\n\n</p><p>Will resolve this for now; we can revisit the platform build question separately.  No part of this touches the release build so will skip version history.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2019-Jun-03 15:54</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/417418d34d01d452b9cf8f2e2ba3ce75ee71ed00\">[57060]</a></span>: Try adding builds for less-common OpenSSL versions on Travis. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7087\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7087'); return false;\" title=\"Make Travis-CI testing more Batlab-like\">#7087</a></span> - Fedora 28 build to catch OpenSSL 1.1.0 issues; PROPER is disabled to guarantee that DLOPEN_SECURITY_LIBS is set. - Mac OS X 10.10 to catch OpenSSL 0.9.8 issues.
