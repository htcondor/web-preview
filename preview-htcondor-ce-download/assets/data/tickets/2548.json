The user log only records the sinful string of the startd but not the slot.\n\n<p>The workaround is to use EVENT_LOG_JOB_AD_INFORMATION_ATTRS to record <code>RemoteHost</code>.  We think the remote host should be recorded by default in the execute event.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Oct-14 14:30", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Oct-13 16:56", "fixed_version": "2011-Oct-13 16:56", "broken_version": "v070000", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "danb", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "dan@hep.wisc.edu,khahn@cs.wisc.edu,tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
