There is also a sporadic collection of older contrib modules for various things if you have an older release of Condor. </td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n\n<p>This is easy to overlook, and fails to enumerate what is actually in the Contrib area at the moment, notably omitting the DMTCP/Condor integration.  We could just modify download.pl to have a more up to date list, but it would likely drift from reality over time.\n\n</p><p>Proposed: The list of Contrib packages has always been short.  Just generate the full list and include it there.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-May-07 16:35:59 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/5717ef30d3658ef3fc48797ae2f2d7d6922a0c2a\">[31940]</a></span> actually belongs to <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"defer\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2973\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2973'); return false;\" title=\"Standard universe may never checkpoint when nscd isn't running\">#2973</a></span>.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2012-May-07 16:35", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Jan-30 11:54", "fixed_version": "2012-Jan-30 11:54", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
