    <h1>Creating Condor Pools At Amazon</h1>
<div id="content">
 One approach to using cloud resources to run HTCondor jobs is to use the
 <code>
  condor_annex
 </code>
 tool to expand an existing pool onto the cloud (see
 <span class="wiki">
  <a href="/web-preview/preview-release/wiki-archive/pages/HowToUseCondorAnnexWithOnDemandInstances" title="How To Use Condor Annex With On Demand Instances">
   HowToUseCondorAnnexWithOnDemandInstances
  </a>
 </span>
 ).  Another approach, documented here, is to create a new HTCondor pool entirely in the cloud.  Although this approach doesn't allow jobs already in a queue to run on cloud resources, it has the advantage that all file-transfer between the queue and the execute nodes occurs within the cloud, which could lead to substantial performance improvements and cost reductions.
 <p>
  The HTCondor team maintains an AWS Marketplace entry to help simplify the process of creating an HTCondor pool at Amazon.
 </p>
 <p>
  To follow these instructions you must already have an AWS account.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Log into AWS
 </h2>
 <p>
  The first step is to log in to
  <a class="external" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com">
   AWS
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  The general approach will be to use the Marketplace entry to start a
  <em>
   head node
  </em>
  , which will be the brains of the new HTCondor pool, as well as be where you'll log in to and submit jobs from.  Once the head node is up and running, you'll use
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  to add cloud resources to your new pool.  Then you can start running jobs, and when they're done, shut everything down.

 <h2>
  1 Launch HTCondor in the Cloud
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this section, you'll launch HTCondor in the Cloud by starting a head node.  A head node needs an address and, for security, a lock.  AWS will automatically provide the address, but you need to do a little work to make sure the lock is one for which you have a key.  For technical reasons, AWS refers to these lock/key pairs as just "key pairs".  If you already have one (if, for instance, you're following these instructions a second time), you can skip to section 1.2, but creating another key pair won't cause problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  1.1 Create a Key Pair
 </h3>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Go to the
   <a class="external" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?#KeyPairs:sort=keyName">
    EC2 key pair console
   </a>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the blue "Create Key Pair" button in the upper left.
  </li>
  <li>
   Enter a name; "HTCondorKeyPair" would be fine.  Click the blue "Create" button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your browser will probably bring up a dialog box asking you what to do with "HTCondorKeyPair.pem".  (It may just start saving it for you.)  Save it some place you won't accidentally delete it and make a note of the location.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  When you later connect to your head node, you'll need to know the location of "HTCondorKeyPair.pem" so you can specify that file.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  1.2 Start a Head Node
 </h3>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Open HTCondor's
   <a class="external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B073WHVRPR">
    Marketplace entry
   </a>
   in another tab.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the orange 'Continue to Subscribe' button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the orange 'Accept Terms' button to actually subscribe.
  </li>
  <li>
   You'll have to wait a while before you can click on the orange 'Continue to Configuration' button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the orange 'Continue to Launch' button to accept the default configuration.
  </li>
  <li>
   Scroll down to 'Security Group Settings' and click on the 'Create New Based On Seller Settings' button.  You'll have to name and escribe the security group; "HTCondor Security Group" would be a fine name.  "Allows SSH and HTCondor from anywhere" is a true description.  (It is more secure to change the two drop-down boxes from 'Anywhere' to 'My Ip', but that doesn't always work, especially if you're on a laptop.)  Finally, click 'Save'.
  </li>
  <li>
   Scroll down to 'Key Pair Settings' and make sure the key pair you created in section 1.1 is selected.
  </li>
  <li>
   You will start spending money when you click on the orange 'Launch' button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click on the 'Your Software' link in the green box.  Leave that tab open; you'll need it later.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <span class="section">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h2>
  2 Add Cloud Resources to Your New Pool
 </h2>
 <p>
  Your head node (by default) starts with two CPUs and 8 GiB of RAM.  Immediately after you log in -- see section 2.1 -- you can start submitting and running jobs (see section 3).  However, with only two CPUs, you'll only be able to run two jobs at a time.  To add cloud resources to your pool, you'll use
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  .  To do that, you'll need to obtain an access key for
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  , so
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  can act interact with AWS on your behalf.  You'll only need to do that once.  Likewise,
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  has to do some one-time set-up for each account.  Once that's done, you can run
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  to add cloud resources as often as you like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  2.1 Log into your Head Node
 </h3>
 <p>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Find the HTCondor entry (in the tab from section 1.2) and click the 'View Instances' button.
  </li>
  <li>
   There should only be one instance; click on the "Manage in AWS Console" link.  This will bring up the EC2 console with your head node selected.
  </li>
  <li>
   Right-click on the selected instance and select 'Connect'.  Follow the instructions, except that the username is 'ec2-user', not 'root'.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  2.2 Obtain an Access Key
 </h3>
 <p>
  Just being able to log into an EC2 instance doesn't give you the privilege to start additional EC2 instances.  In order to use add cloud resources to your new pool, HTCondor needs a pair of security tokens (like a user name and password). Like a user name, the "access key" is (more or less) public information; the corresponding "secret key" is like a password and must be kept a secret. To help keep both halves secret, you never tell HTCondor these keys directly; instead, you tell HTCondor which file to look in to find each one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Create those two files now; we'll tell you how to fill them in shortly.  By convention, these files exist in your
  <code>
   ~/.condor
  </code>
  directory.  In this document, shaded boxes indicate typing in a terminal; you should copy the lines beginning with $, but don't include the $.  The other lines shown in the boxes are the responses you should expect to see.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="term">
  <pre class="term">$ cd ~/.condor
$ touch publicKeyFile privateKeyFile
$ chmod 600 publicKeyFile privateKeyFile
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  The last command ensures that only you can read or write to those files.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you saved your security tokens from the last time you used
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  , copy them into the files you just created and skip to section 2.3.
 </p>
 <p>
  To download a new pair of security tokens for
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  to use, go to the

 <h4>
  2.2.1 Privileged (Administrator) Accounts

   To run on your new resources, a job's submit file must contain the following line:
  </li>

 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="verbatim">
  <pre>+MayUseAWS = TRUE

 <ul>

   The new resources do
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   share a file system with the head node, so you'll need to use file transfer:

  4 Clean Up

 <h3>
  4.1 The Cloud Resources
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the benefits of using
  <code>
   condor_annex
  </code>
  is that the cloud resources in acquires will automatically terminate after a certain amount of time (24 hours in the example above).  This happens even if the instance is running a job at the time, to make sure that misbehaving jobs don't cause you to spend more than you intended.  Additionally, if at any time it's been too long (15 minutes by default) since an instance ran a job, the instance will shut itself down to save you money.  However, if you'd like to shut down the instances early, you can do so using the
  <code>
   condor_off
  </code>
  command, replacing
  <code>
   MyFirstAnnex
  </code>
  with the name of the annex you'd like to shut down:
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="term">
  <pre class="term">$ condor_off -annex MyFirstAnnex
</pre>
 </div>
 <p>
  <span class="subsection">
  </span>
 </p>
 <h3>
  4.2 The Head Node
 </h3>
 <p>
  As noted above, you'll need to clean the head node up yourself.  If you don't want to keep any of your changes, then you should "terminate" the head node to avoid paying for storage.  If you just want to save money and pick up where you left off a bit later, you should instead "stop" the head node; you'll pay to keep its disk around until you start the head node again later.  Both options are under "Instance State" if you right-click on the instance in the EC2 console.
