This also affects our 64-bit platforms where we offer a \"small\" 32-bit shadow.\n\n<p>The job becomes held with the following log event:\n</p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>012 (003.000.000) 02/25 16:03:32 Job was held.\n        Failed to initialize user log to /home/jfrey/test/large.log\n        Code 22 Subcode 0\n...\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Adding O_LARGEFILE to the open() flags allows larger job event files to be written. But since the file size is queried for EVENT_LOG rotation, this is probably insufficient for a proper solution.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2019-Feb-27 13:50:12 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nWe see similar failures when a daemon's debug log grows larger than 2GB.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2019-Mar-07 15:16", "status": "new", "created": "2019-Feb-26 11:11", "fixed_version": "2019-Feb-26 11:11", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "DaemonsSubmitNode", "assigned_to": "jfrey", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
