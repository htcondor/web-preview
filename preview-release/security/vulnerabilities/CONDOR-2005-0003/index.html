  Arbitrary commands can be executed with the permissions of the condor_shadow
  or condor_gridmanager's effective uid (normally the "condor" user).  This can
  result in a compromise of the condor configuration files, log files, and
  other files owned by the "condor" user.  This may also aid in attacks on
  other accounts.

    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  Usually the condor_shadow and condor_gridmanager are configured to run as the
  "condor" user, and this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code as the "condor" user.
<p>  Depending on the configuration, additional more serious attacks may be
  possible.  If the configuration files for the condor_master are writable by
  condor and the condor_master is run with root privileges, then root access
  can be gained.  If the condor binaries are owned by the "condor" user, these
  executables could be replaced and when restarted, arbitrary code could be
  executed as the "condor" user. This would also allow root access as most
  condor daemons are started with an effective uid of root.

<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  The condor_shadow and condor_gridmanager allow the user to be notified by
  email of changes to the status of their job.  Normally, the user's email
  address is derived from the user's account information, but the user is
  allowed to specify the email address for the notification with the
  "notify_user" submit file command.
<p>  Internally, when a notification is required, the application creates a string
  that contains the name of the mail executable ($MAIL), a subject ($subject)
  argument and the value of the notify_user command ($notifyUser).  The
  string's value is of the form '$MAIL -s "$subject" $notifyUser'.  This string
  is then passed to popen as the effective user of "condor," and the option for
  the executable to be a writer.  The executable then writes the body of the
  email message to the file descriptor, closes the file descriptor and then the
  email is sent.
<p>  No checking is performed on the notify_user value, which allows a malicious
  value to have unintended consequences.  The popen library call takes the
  command string passed to it and essentially does the equivalent of the
  following command line:
<p>        <code>/bin/sh -c "$command"</code>
<p>  With stdin or stdout of the command rerouted to the file descriptor returned
  by popen.  If notify_user is set to 'user@example.com; evil_cmd', the email
  will be sent and evil_cmd will be executed with the effective user being
  "condor," as the command that the shell executes is:
<p>        <code>/bin/mail -s "subject" user@example.com; evil_cmd</code>
<p>  For instance, if evil_cmd is 'xterm', then an xterm will open with a shell
  logged in as the "condor" user.
<p>  A similar attack can be done on Windows using the '&amp;' metacharacter
  instead of the ';' metacharacter.

<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  The cause of this is failure to validate that the user supplied email address
  is valid and to quote or escape shell metacharacters passed to popen.

<tr>
    <td width='25%'><p class='h'>Proposed Fix:</p></td>
    <td class='sv'><p class='v'>&nbsp;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td colspan='2' class='sv'><p>
  First, the value of the notify_user option in the submit file needs to be
  checked to make sure it looks like a real email address:  no spaces, and/or
  metacharacters that are not normally found in an email address ('.', '@',
  '-', '_', etc.).  If it does not match this pattern then the job should be
  rejected.  Also, email addresses should be rejected if they begin with a '-'
  as they can be misintrepeted by the mail command as an option.
<p>  Second, user supplied data to the popen library call should be placed in
  single quotes to avoid misintrepation of the command to be executed.  Single
  quotes should be placed around the email address in the command sent to
  popen, and single quotes, if they get through the above, should be escaped by
  replacing them with '\'' (this closes the single quote, inserts a \-quoted
  single quote and reopens the single quote).  In the the example above, the
  command to be executed, if not rejected by the first fix, would become:
<p>        <code>/bin/mail -s "subject" 'user@example.com; evil_cmd'</code>
<p>  This will cause the mail command to fail, since the email address is invalid,
  and access to the "condor" user will not be granted.
<p>  Third, popen should probably be changed to an in-house function that mimics
  popen, but allows the arguments to be passed as a vector containing  one
  entry for the executuble and one for each argument individually, so the use
  of /bin/sh is not required.  This can be done with a pipe, fork, and execv or
  execve system calls so the calling environment and argument interpretation
  can be better controlled.  This would eliminate the need to deal with quoting
  at all.
<p>  Fourth, the subject should be enclosed in single quotes instead of double
  quotes to prevent problems in the future.  Even though the subject is not
  user supplied, a change to make it so would enable this attack on the
  subject.  Also, the subject should have single quotes escaped as above to
  prevent future problems if the subject were to include a single quote
  character.

  Call to popen was replaced with new my_popenv and implements the third
  proposed fix above, which eliminates the use of the shell and mitigates the
