{"id": 643, "title": "Ticket #643: Rewrite param_info_c_generator.pl and param_info.in", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe current format of param_info.in is a windows INI style format. This should be replaced with a file that encodes all of the data as a perl data structure, written in actual perl.\n\n<p>Then the param_info_c_generator.pl should be rewritten to take advantage of this. The generator script also needs some typechecking.\n\n</p><p>I happen to have a new perl codes that implement the start of this, but it is taking a while to convert the INI file to it.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2009-Aug-03 16:45:40 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nMake sure to change this construct:\n\n<p><code>name    =&gt; 'SCHEDD_BACKUP_SPOOL',</code>\n\n</p><p>into this construct:\n\n</p><p><code>name    =&gt; [ 'SCHEDD_BACKUP_SPOOL' , __LINE__],</code>\n\n</p><p>Since this will simplify emitting information about the default table immensely. One example is you could ask the tool would would it give \"right now\" if you looked up a variable, and if a pattern match happened to happen, you could know exactly which pattern match it was on what line of the perl description file.\nOther good things would be if two variables were found duplicated, both could\nbe emitted nicely.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Mar-30 13:51", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Jul-30 13:30", "fixed_version": "2009-Jul-30 13:30", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "#123", "creator": "psilord", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "psilord@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
