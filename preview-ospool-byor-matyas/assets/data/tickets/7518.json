{"id": 7518, "title": "Ticket #7518: Build only the man pages in testing", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7141\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7141'); return false;\" title=\"Replace Python bindings tutorials in docs with rendered notebooks\">#7141</a></span> we needed to introduce extra Python package dependencies for a full manual build. This caused our batlab test builds to fail because the packages were missing. But we don't actually need to build the full manual in those builds, only the man pages (because that's what we ship).\n\n<p>The problem is that we use sphinx to build both the manual and the man pages, and sphinx will try to import all of the specified extensions. So, we need to (somehow) not have <code>nbsphinx</code> in the list of extensions when we build on batlab, and we should only build the man pages themselves.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2020-Apr-10 07:46:37 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v080906 to v080907 using ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2020-Apr-13 10:13", "status": "resolved", "created": "2020-Feb-24 12:11", "fixed_version": "2020-Feb-24 12:11", "broken_version": "v080904", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Unknown", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "#7141", "creator": "karpel", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tim@cs.wisc.edu, karpel@wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
