However, the logic appears to fail on 64-bit non-x86 platforms.\n\n</p><p>The patch from Fedora looks OK -- however, it's probably safer to have cmake generate the header file with the appropriate value.  We don't want to maintain our own int64_t detection logic in addition to what's in cmake.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-Jun-26 12:03:19 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nThis is no longer a problem in the current code base.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2020-Jun-26 12:03", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2015-Sep-09 09:16", "fixed_version": "2015-Sep-09 09:16", "broken_version": "", "priority": "2", "subsystem": "Packaging", "assigned_to": "tim", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "bbockelm@cse.unl.edu", "due_date": ""}
