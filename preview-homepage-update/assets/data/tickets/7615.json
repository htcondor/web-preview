{"id": 7615, "title": "Ticket #7615: New and old schedds and negotiators in 8.9 can't talk with each other", "description": "<blockquote>\nAn 8.9.3 schedd can't talk with an 8.9.4+ negotiator and an 8.9.4+ schedd can't talk with an 8.9.3 negotiator. This is due to the combination of two recent changes. In 8.9.3, <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6956\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6956'); return false;\" title='\"Match password auth\" for schedds'>#6956</a></span> added a non-negotiated security session between the schedd and the negotiator, communicated via the submitter ad. This is similar to the match session between the startd and the schedd. Unlike the startd/schedd match session, when the schedd exports the session info for the negotiator, it doesn't include the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CryptoMethods\" title=\"Crypto Methods\">CryptoMethods</a></span> attribute. In 8.8.6 and 8.9.4, the default encryption method was changed from 3DES to BLOWFISH. Since the schedd doesn't specify which encryption method to use in the schedd/negotiator security session, each side uses its default, which is different between 8.9.3 and 8.9.4+.\n\n<p>When the schedd creates the security session string for the submitter ad, it should use SecMan::ExportSecSessionInfo() to get the security policy ad. This call returns a policy ad that includes the crucial <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CryptoMethods\" title=\"Crypto Methods\">CryptoMethods</a></span> attribute. The schedd should also use the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ClaimIdParser\" title=\"Claim Id Parser\">ClaimIdParser</a></span> class to construct the full session string (this doesn't pertain to this bug, but may help avoid future ones).\n\n</p><p>For new negotiators talking to 8.9.3 schedds, we can force the encryption method to be 3DES in the negotiator if the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CondorVersion\" title=\"Condor Version\">CondorVersion</a></span> attribute in the submitter ad says it's 8.9.3.\n\n</p><p>This bug will affect Condor versions 8.9.4-8.9.6 if the admin changes the default encryption algorithm for either the negotiator or the schedd.\n\n</p><p>A workaround for this bug is to set NEGOTIATOR.SEC_ENABLE_MATCH_PASSWORD_AUTHENTICATION=False in the config for the negotiator. Setting this for the schedd is not be viable for pools with busy schedds (i.e. schedds managing more than a few thousand running jobs), as it affects startd/schedd non-negotiated sessions as well.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2020-May-18 13:09:58 by zmiller:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE REVIEW</strong>:  Looks good.
