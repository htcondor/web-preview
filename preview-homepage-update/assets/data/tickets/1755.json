{"id": 1755, "title": "Ticket #1755: Have a -strict flag that turns some warnings into fatal errors", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn the case of a number of warnings, such as the proposed warning for priority categories with no nodes, I think that in many cases users will never notice the warnings, because if the DAG runs they probably won't look at the dagman.out file.  So I think it would make sense to have a -strict flag that turns warnings into fatal errors, so that users would be sure to notice them...</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Apr-26 09:31:26 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nI started working on this, and one thing I decided partway through is that there should be several levels of strictness.  (For the highest level, <strong>any</strong> warning would become a fatal error, but for lower levels only more \"severe\" warnings would become fatal errors.)\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 13:54:49 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nI reviewed it; The patch looks good.  My only question is, \"Why is there is not a command-line option, in addition to the config file option?\"  I also wonder if this could be inserted into a DAG submit file\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 15:16:47 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nAs far as why no command-line option, there could be one, but with per-DAG config files, I don't really see that much need.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Jun-01 15:32:55 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nOK. I forgot about per-DAG config files, so that is question is vacuous.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body><blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../files/365/dagman_strict.patch\">dagman_strict.patch</a>\n19416 bytes added by wenger on 2011-Jun-01 17:59:22 UTC.\n<br/>\nProposed changes to implement this -- went to 3 levels of strictness.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Jun-01 16:22</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f4d7d8c1505e7f56421f6c98950555287f4bd9f0\">[26109]</a></span>: Gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1755\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1755'); return false;\" title=\"Have a -strict flag that turns some warnings into fatal errors\">#1755</a></span>: documented the new DAGMAN_USE_STRICT config macro.
