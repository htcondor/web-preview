Subject: RE: condor rpm - flag init script as config

We've gone a few rounds with the flightworthy condor team on this too, without satisfaction to date.
As you know there are actually two init scripts that ship with the main condor rpm, one redhattish init script that looks like a basic init for any other service, and another that is supposed to work for every possible Unix but actually works for none.  The latter is the default.

We customize in the following ways:
1) we add a ulimit statement to boost the number of allowed file descriptors.
2) we add a new command to the init script, service condor drain, which sends a condor_off -peaceful to the condor_master on the node.
3) We fix the /var/lock/subsys file so it is the correct  name.  Otherwise the redhat shutdown script doesn't even attempt to shut down condor at system shutdown, which can lead to a virtual machine hang if you are running condor in a VM.

Now of course we could just shove out a new file with puppet and will probably have to do so, but what I prefer to do is to make an auxiliary RPM to push out the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ script plus the correct condor_config.local file, etc.
With /etc/rc.d/init.d file not tagged as a config file, any update of the condor rpm will blow any customizations away, and any other rpm that wants to modify that file has to put it out there as /etc/rc.d/init.d/condor-init.fermi or 
Something like that and then move it into place with a %post.

So the first priority is to fix the locking function..which has been fixed a couple of times in the redhattish 
Script but never in the other one.  The second priority is to add a "drain" function.  The third priority
Would be to add a callout to a sourceable config script to get the ulimit right.

And I don't think this is a strange request.
In VDT-land, hacking init scripts is a time-honored tradition that everyone was doing and there was a way to preserve  the hacks in post-install.  Just asking for the same level of hackability we had before.

Hi,

This is a very strange request.  Can you elaborate on the use case?

FWIW - this is likely *impossible* to support in RHEL7 as init scripts go away.  I'd rather understand the use case as we're going to have to undo it next year.
