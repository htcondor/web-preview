However, none of the callouts need to happen as root, since all interactions with libvirt occur via the client library now. Condor 7.5.4 is also affected.\n\n<p>We'll do the following changes now. Additional changes can wait for later.\n</p><ul>\n<li>Fix systemCommand() to perform callouts as root when requested.\n</li><li>Remove check for uid root from condor_vm_xen.sh.\n</li><li>Remove call to virsh from check routine in condor_vm_xen.sh.</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Dec-10 16:29:23 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nPushed changes to V7_4-branch for 7.4.5.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Dec-10 16:26</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/907949d1ab4ddda335d029fb555cc3c6479ccbc8\">[19631]</a></span>: Fix vm_gahp callouts for xen/kvm. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1803\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1803'); return false;\" title=\"vm_gahp xen/kvm script callouts as wrong user\">#1803</a></span> Due to a bug in a code refactoring for 7.4.4, script callouts from the vm_gahp that should happen as root instead happen as the executing user.
