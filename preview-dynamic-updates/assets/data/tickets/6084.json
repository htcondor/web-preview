(Most of the time, at least, you won't be getting any job_ad_information events unless you specifically generate them.  Although I could see a case where you might want such events in the \"regular\" user log file but not the nodes.log file.)\n\n<p>Hmm -- maybe we should add a knob to let the user specify \"extra\" event types that will be allowed in the nodes.log file (we shouldn't let them <strong>remove</strong> any event types, because that would goof up DAGMan).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2017-Apr-06 17:16", "status": "new", "created": "2017-Jan-10 11:23", "fixed_version": "2017-Jan-10 11:23", "broken_version": "v080508", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "coatsworth", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "lsst", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, gthain@cs.wisc.edu, coatsworth@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
