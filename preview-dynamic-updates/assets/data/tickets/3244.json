Perhaps there was a different filesystem causing the hang between there?  In any case, the schedd was blocked for 53 minutes.\n\n</p><p>Then, a rather large amount of backlogged work started happening, and the schedd noticed that it had not heard from any of its children in the CHILD_ALIVE timeout, and killed them all, assuming that they were hung.  While this is merely annoying for children of the schedd which are shadows, it is really bad for the local universe starters, as it just kill -9s them, so there's no chance for the starter to clean up the job.\n\n</p><p>We'll have to think about the right way in HTCondor to fix this, but in the short term, on the submit machine, you should be able to set\n\n</p><p>NOT_RESPONDING_TIMEOUT\n\n</p><p>to some very large value.
