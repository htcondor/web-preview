Changes for version 0.9.7: (released 28-Oct-2004) 

* The ClassAd tarball (and corresponding directory within the tarball)
  that is downloaded has changed it's format from
  classads_<version>.tar.gz to classads-version.tar.gz. This allows
  the ClassAd library to be used more easily in Condor--I hope it
  doesn't cause anyone problems.

* The name of the classad library now depends on the compile time
  options. There are four possible names:

  Name               | Classad Namespace? | Shared Library Functions?
  -------------------+--------------------+---------------------------
  libclassad.a       |       No           |            No
  libclassad_ns.a    |       Yes          |            Yes
  libclassad_sh.a    |       No           |            No
  libclassad_sh_ns.a |       Yes          |            Yes

  If you don't want these names, you can use the --libname argument to
  configure. To get the old behavior, you would have:

    configure --lib-name libclassad.a

* We are gradually improving the C++ API documentation. Early results
  can be seen at:

  http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/classad/c++doc/

* The ClassAd library now defines a CLASSAD_EXCEPT macro instead of
  using EXCEPT. This avoids a conflict with Condor.
