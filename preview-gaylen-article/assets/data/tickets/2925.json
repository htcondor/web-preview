{"id": 2925, "title": "Ticket #2925: DAGMan will fail if node job user logs are rotated", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe actual event reading code can now handle log file rotation; but DAGMan decided to call the event reading code based on the log file(s) getting bigger.  That obviously could be broken by log file rotation...\n\n<p>I'm not sure that we couldn't just go ahead and call the ReadMultipleUserLogs::readEvent() method without first checking the log file size.  (I'm not sure -- we need to check whether that's significantly less efficient before we go with it.)\n\n</p><p>At any rate, we should change things around such that log file rotation doesn't goof things up; and add a test for it!\n\n</p><p>Oh, yeah -- this has probably been broken since forever on the DAGMan end, but it's not until relatively recently that we had the capability to rotate job user logs, I think.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2012-May-02 15:46:35 by nwp:</em> <br/>\n\nWho rotates user logs and why is it a good idea?</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2012-May-02 15:46", "status": "new", "created": "2012-Apr-05 16:35", "fixed_version": "2012-Apr-05 16:35", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Dag", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
