{"id": 2391, "title": "Ticket #2391: Setup condor submit side machinery in new batlab", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe next step in porting the condor builds to the new batlab is getting the submit side infrastructure running.  Note that there are many changes between the old batlab and the new.  These include:  SL6 on the submit node instead of SL4, PHP5 (which breaks our dashboard), new version of metronome, no cached externals support, no prereqs, etc.\n\n<p>We know that condor will build on 64-bit fedora 14, so this ticket will get this one platform building hourly with all the submit side infrastructure working.  Then, every other execute platform can be worked on in parallel.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Aug-22 11:19:40 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nAs of Friday, 8/19, the hourly builds are running in the new batlab on 64 bit fedora 14, rhel5, rhel6, and sl6.  deb 6 is trying to build, but is missing at least the pam-devel module.  The test are running very slowly, as they start up a new personal condor each test, and this takes two minutes for some reason.  About half the tests are failing.\n\n<p>The daily submit framework isn't set up, I'd like to redo that so we don't have two cron jobs running on two different machines communiciating via rsync.\n\n</p><p>Note that fixing the test is likely a week long activity.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2011-Sep-12 13:38:06 by gthain:</em> <br/>\n\nsubmit-2 is now running hourly builds.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=2408\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('2408'); return false;\" title=\"Identify test problems in new batlab\">#2408</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nIdentify test problems in new batlab</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2011-Sep-12 13:38", "status": "resolved", "created": "2011-Aug-15 13:52", "fixed_version": "2011-Aug-15 13:52", "broken_version": "v070701", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "gthain", "derived_from": "", "creator": "gthain", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": "20110819"}
