{"id": 2637, "title": "Ticket #2637: Clarify condor_shared_port documentation and add examples", "description": "<blockquote>\nThere are a number of questions about condor_shared_port that aren't really answered in the manual.  For example:\n<ul>\n<li>How does the port for condor_shared_port relate to HIGHPORT/LOWPORT (e.g., should it be outside the HIGHPORT/LOWPORT range)?\n</li><li>How does the port for condor_shared_port relate to 9618?\n</li><li>Does the shared port include the collector?\n</li><li>Does the shared port need to be open (in the firewall) on every node that runs\ncondor_master?\n</li><li>If you set up condor_shared_port, will a condor_reconfig make that take effect, or do you need to do condor_off/condor_on?\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Also, it would be great if the example configuration files had examples for all of the shared port configuration -- for instance, there is no example for SHARED_PORT_ARGS.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Nov-15 14:38:49 by wenger:</em> <br/>\n\nAlso, the manual says that the collector <strong>can</strong> be configured to use a shared port; but the details of the collector configuration are unclear about what is mandatory if you used a shared port at all, and what is only necessary if the collector uses a shared port.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "doc", "last_change": "2011-Nov-15 14:38", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Nov-15 13:13", "fixed_version": "2011-Nov-15 13:13", "broken_version": "v070702", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "wenger", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "wenger@cs.wisc.edu, smoler@cs.wisc.edu, danb@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
