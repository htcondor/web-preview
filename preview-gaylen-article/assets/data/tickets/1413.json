They have a more complicated setup but Doug was able to reproduce the failure with a pretty simple .bat file.\n\n<p>Pre 7.0.5 everything was fine. This cron job caused no issues and ran successfully on Windows. With a switch to 7.4.2 Hartford is unable to run the cron job. Doug confirmed this was still working as of 7.2.x.\n\n</p><p>Here are the details for recreating the problem using a simple .bat file:\n\n</p><p>In your config file:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>STARTD_CRON_NAME = SYSCAPS\nSYSCAPS_JOBLIST = PRTDIAG\nSYSCAPS_PRTDIAG_EXECUTABLE = C:/Condor/test.bat\nSYSCAPS_PRTDIAG_PERIOD = 1m\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The file used is a simple batch file:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>echo %TIME% &gt; c:\\condor\\test.out\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>We get the following output in <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=StartLog\" title=\"Start Log\">StartLog</a></span>:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>05/14 15:33:47 Create_Process(): executable: 'C:/Condor/test.bat'\n05/14 15:33:47 Executable is a batch file, running: \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /Q /C \"C:/Condor/test.bat\" PRTDIAG\n05/14 15:33:47 GetBinaryType() returned 0\n05/14 15:33:47 Create_Process: CreateProcess failed, errno=267\n05/14 15:33:47 Cron: Error running job 'PRTDIAG'\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>In 7.2 we got this output:\n\n</p><p></p><div class=\"verbatim\">\n<pre>5/14 12:34:25 Executable is a batch script, so executing C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe  /Q /C \"C:/Condor/test.bat\"  PRTDIAG\n5/14 12:34:25 GetBinaryType() returned 0\n5/14 12:34:25 Cron: STDOUT closed for 'PRTDIAG'\n5/14 12:34:25 Cron: STDERR closed for 'PRTDIAG'\n5/14 12:34:25 Cron: 'PRTDIAG' (pid 448) exit_status=0\n</pre></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2010-Jun-02 19:49:08 by ichesal:</em> <br/>\n\nHey guys: any updates on this?
