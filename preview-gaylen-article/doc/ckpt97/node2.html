One of the major components of Condor is its facility for
transparently checkpointing and restarting a process, possibly on a
different machine.  By ``transparent'' we mean that the user code is
not specially written to accommodate the checkpoint/restart or
migration and generally has no knowledge that such an event has taken
place.  This mechanism is implemented entirely at user level, with
absolutely no modifications to the UNIX kernel.  While implementing
checkpoint/restart and migration at user level is great for
portability, it should be pointed out from the beginning that our
method does have some limitations.  These are discussed in detail is
section <A HREF="node16.html#seclimitations">4.2</A>.
<P>
Process checkpoint/restart can enable process migration.
Checkpointing and restarting generally implies that the state of a
process is saved in stable storage using the file system.  Note
however that in an environment where processes can access files from
any of a group of machines, (possibly via AFS or NFS cross mounting of
file systems), then by transporting a checkpoint file to another
machine we accomplish process migration.  In this article we use the
term ``checkpoint'' almost synonymously with ``migrate''.  Not all
systems which implement process migration however also provide the
safety of checkpointing, because they may not allow ``migrating'' a
process into a file.  Condor provides access to files across machines,
even in environments where files are not generally available by NFS or
AFS, with a mechanism called ``remote system calls''.  These are
discussed in section <A HREF="node15.html#secremote">4.1</A>.
<P>
Our general method for checkpointing is to write all of the process's
state information to a file (or socket) at checkpoint time, then use
the information in that file (or read from a socket) to restore the
process's state (as much as possible) at restart time.  From the point
of view of the operating system, the process is not restarted or
migrated at all - we simply create a new process, and manipulate its
state so as to emulate the state of the old process as accurately as
possible.  The checkpointing process is invoked by a signal, and at
restart time, things are manipulated so that it appears to the user
code that the process has just returned from that signal handler.  The
code contained in the signal handler, the code required to install the
handler, and the code used to record information about the process's
state as it evolves, are all contained in the Condor checkpointing
library.
