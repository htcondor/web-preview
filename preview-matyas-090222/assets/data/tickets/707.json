{"id": 707, "title": "Ticket #707: GCB configure should check libc prototypes", "description": "<blockquote>\nGCB wraps a number of libc functions.  The prototypes need to exactly match the real definition from libc, or else potential problems crop up.  <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=705\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('705'); return false;\" title=\"GCB causes daemons to hang\">#705</a></span> is such an example.  configure (as created from configure.ac by autoconf) should be able to help.  configure should check that the libc versions are identical to what GCB is hard coded to use.  If they disagree, it's a fatal error.\n\n<p>An even better solution is to have configure change the definitions GCB is using to match, but note that this is complex as changing a return type in one location really requires changing it in other GCB functions and local variables.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Nov-09 16:51:20 by adesmet:</em> <br/>\n\nGCB is dead.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Nov-21 15:58", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2009-Sep-02 11:09", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-02 11:09", "broken_version": "", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
