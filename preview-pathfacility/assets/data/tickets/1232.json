{"id": 1232, "title": "Ticket #1232: batch_test.pl should support non-perl tests", "description": "<blockquote>\nbatch_test.pl launches tests with the command \"perl $testprogram\".  This has the advantage that the program will start even if perl isn't in the location specified in the #! line, or if the operating system doesn't respect #! at all (Windows).  However, it means we can't ever add a, say, Python test.\n\n<p>Proposal: Wrap the launch in a wrapper that sniffs the file and calls the appropriate interpreter (or maybe even runs a native binary directly).  Start with Perl support, add others as the need arises.  Unsupported should cause the test to fail with a clear message. \"Could not identify interpreter for test foo.run; appears to want '#! /bin/sh'\"</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<em>2010-Oct-20 16:03:30 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070504 to v070505 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Jan-27 14:46:04 by danb:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070505 to v070506 using ./ticket-target-mover.\n<hr/>\n<em>2011-Feb-01 16:01:00 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nBulk change of target version from v070506 to NULL using ./ticket-target-mover.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Feb-01 16:01", "status": "new", "created": "2010-Feb-18 17:14", "fixed_version": "2010-Feb-18 17:14", "broken_version": "v070500", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Tests", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
