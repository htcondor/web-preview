{"id": 5199, "title": "Ticket #5199: Benchmark overhead of using filename encryption in ecryptfs", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe had an incident where someone was using ECRYPTFS and had 10's of thousands of files in their execute sandbox.  We hypothesize that ECRYPTFS filename encryption was slowing down the process of walking the directory tree to determine disk usage.  As such, we turned it off by default but made a knob to enable it if needed.  However, we have no real metrics for if this makes any difference.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2015-Aug-05 11:16", "status": "new", "created": "2015-Aug-05 11:16", "fixed_version": "2015-Aug-05 11:16", "broken_version": "v080300", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
