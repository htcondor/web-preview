All symbols provided by\n          those libraries are provided by libsystemd.so.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Given that the RPM configuration requires this library to work with the shipped unit file, we ought to add an explicit <code>Requires:</code>.\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Jan-05 13:53:04 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nSeems like the way to fix this is to tell our code to dlopen libsystemd.so instead of libsystemd-daemon.so.  Patch incoming.  And this same patch should be fine on RHEL7 as well since it uses systemd-219, so it seems like we can unconditionally do it everywhere since I don't feel like we need to support older-then-rhel7 distros that use systemd-208 or earlier.\n\n<p>Brian, by the above do you mean we should have a Build-Requires: systemd-devel (which we already do) and a Requires: systemd (which we do not have).  We could add this, but it seems like every system using systemd prolly already has libsystemd.so installed, right?\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Jan-05 13:59:37 by bbockelm:</em> <br/>\n\nThat gets down to why we <code>dlopen</code> the library in the first place.  Technically, Debian defaults to systemd but it should be possible to put together a system that utilizes other inits.  We didn't want HTCondor to fail in such a setup.\n\n<p>For RHEL7, it's clear: no one should object to a hard dependency on systemd from HTCondor.\n\n</p><p>Doesn't Debian have a softer version of <code>Requires:</code> that we could use?  Something like \"install systemd-libs if systemd itself is installed?\"\n\n</p><p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Jan-05 14:34:15 by tannenba:</em> <br/>\n\nOk, I pushed some patches (I was in this part of cmake anyway).  Assigning to TimT for code review / testing (I don't have easy access to Fedora 25).  Also TimT, please confirm that with the patch we do NOT see the watchdog notification unavailable error in the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=MasterLog\" title=\"Master Log\">MasterLog</a></span> on RHEL7, just to be sure I didn't regress anything.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2017-Jan-26 21:05:31 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nNo regression on CentOS7. <strong>CODE REVIEW:</strong> Looks good</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Jan-05 14:11</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f8ac52816f4d4ee68b20a458664972071efc5b85\">[49924]</a></span>: Require systemd dependecy in RPM on RHEL7+ or Fedora16+. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6075\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6075'); return false;\" title=\"Watchdog problems in Fedora 25\">#6075</a></span>  (By Todd Tannenbaum )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2017-Jan-05 14:09</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/fead4f537b9575459a5420b74a3146bf2dfddbc1\">[49923]</a></span>: Don't use deprecated libsystemd-daemon.so, use libsystemd.so instead. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6075\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6075'); return false;\" title=\"Watchdog problems in Fedora 25\">#6075</a></span> Since systemd-209, systemd-daemon has been deprecated, and now in Fedora 25 they actually no longer ship that library.
