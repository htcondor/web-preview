{"id": 732, "title": "Ticket #732: Config file filenames are case-sensitive on Windows", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen reading the config files and tracking which files have already been read, Condor treats the filenames as case-sensitive on both Windows and unix. On Windows, they should be case-insensitive.\n\n<p>In the rust ticket, the user's config files defined LOCAL_DIR twice, once as <code>C:\\condor</code> and once as <code>C:\\Condor</code>. This resulted in one local config file being read twice, the second time out of order.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "defect", "last_change": "2010-Jan-31 13:48", "status": "new", "created": "2009-Sep-11 11:31", "fixed_version": "2009-Sep-11 11:31", "broken_version": "v070302", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Libs", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "jfrey", "rust": "a19699", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
