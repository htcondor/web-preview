{"id": 1531, "title": "Ticket #1531: Manual section on the dedicated scheduler is really misleading", "description": "<blockquote>\nIn Section 3.13.10 of the Manual, \"Condor's Dedicated Scheduling\", the big picture/intro is really misleading.  The only reason one needs to bother setting up a dedicated scheduler is to support the execution of parallel universe jobs. Instead of simply stating this, the manual has a bunch of text implying that you need to setup a dedicated scheduler if you have dedicated resources (as opposed to opportunistic resources).  That's nuts, if you have dedicated resources, just set START=True, SUSPEND=FALSE, and PREEMPT=FALSE on your cluster machines, and you're done.  Seems like <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/doc/beowulf-chapter-rev1.pdf\">this book chapter</a> does a better job of explaining all this, maybe the Manual should lift some text/examples from it.\n\n<p>Behold the misleading Manual text:\n</p><div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table width=\"95%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\n  \nApplications that require multiple resources, yet must not be preempted, are handled gracefully by Condor. Condor combines opportunistic scheduling and dedicated scheduling within a single system. Opportunistic scheduling involves placing a job on a non-dedicated resource under the assumption that the resource may not be available for the entire duration of the job. Dedicated scheduling assumes the constant availability of resources; it is assumed that the job will run to completion, without interruption. To support applications needing dedicated resources, an administrator configures resources to be dedicated. These resources are controlled by a dedicated scheduler, a single machine within the pool that runs a condor_schedd daemon.\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2011-Apr-15 15:18</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/2039263ee2db3f9d2a715f4a98bf2f4b3c2a28fc\">[26014]</a></span>: little editing of introductory paragraph describing dedicated scheduler, to complete gittrac <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1531\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1531'); return false;\" title=\"Manual section on the dedicated scheduler is really misleading\">#1531</a></span>.
