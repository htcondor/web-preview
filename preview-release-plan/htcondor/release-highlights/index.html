<p>The Condor team is pleased to announce the release of Condor version 7.7.2.  This is the third release in the development series.  This release dynamically links more libraries than before, resulting in a 30 percent decrease in download size on most operating systems.  Please be aware that due to a difference in older condor_master binaries, condor_masters older than 7.7.2, including all 7.6 releases, can not re-exec a 7.7.2 master.  That is, if you try to upgrade a pre-7.7.2 system just by copying over binaries, the condor_master will shutdown, and must be manually restarted.  7.7.2 masters can re-exec themselves without incident.

<p>The Condor team is pleased to announce the release of Condor 7.7.1.  This is the second release in the development series.  This release of Condor now dynamically links the executables to the system security libraries, including openssl.  In the past, these libraries have been statically linked into the binaries.  As a result, system security updates will immediately benefit Condor.  The downside is that binaries built for a given platform may not be as portable to other platforms as in the past.  We have also seen a very rare, intermittent problem with DAGMan where the DAGMan program will ignore a successful job completion, and wait forever.  We hope to resolve this problem in the next development release.  The <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html">Version History</a>  has a list of the major changes.

      <b>6.1.7</b>
      <div>
        <p>Condor 6.1.7 is now available for <a href="downloads/">download</a> for Alpha Linux and Intel Linux with glibc. There are no other new features, and no bug fixes from 6.1.6, so we do not even provide binaries for 6.1.7 on any other platforms. On Alpha Linux, we only support <i>vanilla</i> jobs at this time. There is no support for checkpointing and remote system calls yet (though we’ll be working on that and making it available ASAP). For Intel, all of the linking problems with machines using glibc 2.0.X and the various versions of EGCS have been resolved in 6.1.7. Therefore, Red Hat 5.X and Debian 2.0.X should work.  <font color="#ff0000"> Red Hat 6.0 and the latest Debian release are NOT SUPPORTED by Condor yet.  They use the new 2.2.X Linux kernel, and glibc version 2.1.X, which are not supported at this time.  </font> Sometime soon, we’ll support all combinations of kernels, compilers, and versions of libc that are available with Linux.

      <div>
        
<p>Condor 6.1.6 is now available for <a href="downloads/">download</a>. Version 6.1.6 fixes many serious bugs from 6.1.5. In addition, it provides many new features, including the ability to dynamically reconfigure the number of virtual machines reported by the SMP startd, SMP support for Digital Unix machines and much more. There are still some unresolved problems with Linux running Red Hat 5.2 (LINUX-GLIBC).  This platform is not supported in 6.1.6.  A 6.1.7 release will follow very soon, which will support Red Hat 5.2. Red Hat 6.0 is NOT SUPPORTED by Condor yet.  It uses the new 2.2.X Linux kernel, which is not supported at this time. <font color="#ff0000"> Like all development releases, this release is INCOMPATIBLE with previous versions of Condor.  DO NOT TRY TO USE IT IN A POOL WITH ANY 6.1.5 DAEMONS.  </font> For complete details, you can read about <a href="manual/latest-dev/9_Version_History.html">what’s new</a> in this version.</p>

Major things that are fixed in this release are: Fortran under Linux, Redhat 5.2 support, condor_preen fixes, and others…   NOTE: condor_userprio, condor_stats, the -pool option to many Condor tools, and Condor PVM are all broken by a change introduced in 6.1.5.

      <b>6.0.3</b>
      <div>
        
<p>This is the new, stable version of Condor.  It fully supports Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6 on Intel and Sparc platforms, Linux for Intel (libc5 and glibc), SGI IRIX 6.2 through 6.4, Digital Unix 4.0, and HPUX 10.20. You can read about <a href="manual/latest-stable/9_Version_History.html">what’s new</a> in this version.  This version only fixes bugs in Condor’s interaction with NIS, and with the benchmarking code that was causing a floating point exception (SIGFPE) on extremely fast machines (like the fastest Alphas).  If you don’t use NIS, or you weren’t having problems with the condor_startd exiting with signal 8, there’s no need to upgrade.</p>
