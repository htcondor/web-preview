This was\n  very surprising.\n</pre>\n\n<p></p><pre>  The logs are uninteresting and I can't tell what the startd was doing\n  when the master thought it was hung. Maybe the master should explain\n  what method it tried whyen it discovered it was hung, like couldn't\n  connect to it, or a signal send had a bad return code, etc.\n</pre>\n\n<p>See the linked condor-admin ticket for the output of 'condor_gather _info'.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2013-Aug-28 12:38:24 by tlmiller:</em> <br/>\n\nAsked Pete to clarify the sequence of events.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "incident", "last_change": "2013-Aug-28 12:38", "status": "pending", "created": "2013-Aug-27 14:15", "fixed_version": "2013-Aug-27 14:15", "broken_version": "v070802", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "DaemonsExecNode", "assigned_to": "tlmiller", "derived_from": "", "creator": "tlmiller", "rust": "a25953", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "tlmiller@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
