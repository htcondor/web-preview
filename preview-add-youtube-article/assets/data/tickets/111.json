{"id": 111, "title": "Ticket #111: Merge OSG ProcD into Condor", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe ProcD that ships with the VDT is a fork of the one that exists in Condor. The code for the OSG ProcD is on V7_1-procd_osg-branch in the Condor Git repository. The wiki page <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=OsgProcd\" title=\"Osg Procd\">OsgProcd</a></span> describes the OSG ProcD in further detail. The functionality added for the OSG ProcD should be merged back into Condor. This mainly includes:\n\n<p></p><ul>\n<li>Better logging and configuration in the ProcD thanks to it being linked with the standard Condor libraries.\n</li><li>The ability to specify a GID to use for tracking a family, rather than having the ProcD allocate one to use.\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Before merging this in, I think it'd be wise to change the ProcD to run with Condor's UID in <span class=\"wiki\"><a href=\"wiki?p=PrivSep\" title=\"Priv Sep\">PrivSep</a></span> mode (See <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"abandoned\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=110\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('110'); return false;\" title=\"Change ProcD to run without root privilege\">#110</a></span>: Change ProcD to run without root privilege).</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Jan-12 16:20:29 by psilord:</em> <br/>\n\nSigh.

I also forgot this ticket existed in my hectic dash to complete the work.\n\n<p>Now the work is completed and pushed into the master.
