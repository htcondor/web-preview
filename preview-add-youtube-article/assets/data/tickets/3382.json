{"id": 3382, "title": "Ticket #3382: Removing a spot instance before instantiation causes it to go on hold.", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf you remove a spot job before it starts an instance, you go to GM_SPOT_CANCEL, which cancels the spot request and goes to GM_SUBMITTED (in case an instance needs to be stopped).  GM_SUBMITTED immediately jumps to GM_CANCEL, because the condorState of the job is still REMOVED.  GM_CANCEL tries to stop the instance, but fails -- there not being an instance -- which puts the job on hold.  The fix is for GM_CANCEL to only try to stop the instance if we know about one.</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2012-Dec-14 11:51</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f110e49ef6eede710c32a2abac17006530fb0db4\">[34388]</a></span>: (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=3382\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('3382'); return false;\" title=\"Removing a spot instance before instantiation causes it to go on hold.\">#3382</a></span>) Don't put a removed spot job on hold for not having an instance.
