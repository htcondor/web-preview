{"id": 6346, "title": "Ticket #6346: condor_store_cred won't accept registration of dedicated user cred.", "description": "<blockquote>\n<span class=\"subsection\"><h3>Problem description</h3></span>\n\n<p>I'm using a setup of HTCondor on Windows which executes jobs using a dedicated user account (SLOT_USER). I can't use the standard \"transient\" accounts as the user account used for the jobs needs special privileges which I configured for the dedicated account.\n\n</p><p>I used to register the dedicated account credentials on execution machines using condor_store_cred. This worked fine in Condor version 8.4.x and earlier.\n\n</p><p>When switching from HTCondor version 8.4.7 to 8.6.4 the setup stopped working though and the condor_store_cred failed to store the credentials of the dedicated account and printed its standard error message:\n\n</p><p>\"Operation failed. Make sure your ALLOW_WRITE setting includes this host.\"\n\n</p><p>Digging through the source I found a part which was introduced in the 8.6 series as it seems:\n\n</p><p>condor-8.6.4/src/condor_utils/store_cred.cpp (line 725):\n// We don't allow one user to set another user's credential\n\n</p><p>The code part which follows leads to the failure. As this breaks the existing feature of having a dedicated user account on Windows to run the jobs I think that this should be considered as a bug. One may argue that the setup still works and one has to log in using the dedicated account but this makes the setup really cumbersome.\n\n</p><p><span class=\"subsection\"></span></p><h3>Proposed fix</h3>\n\n<p>To address the above, we can add a configuration knob that would allow the admin to say who, if anyone, is allowed to run condor_store_cred for other users.  So after this change, to get the behavior you used to have in v8.4, you would put into your condor_config something like:\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    CRED_SUPER_USERS = *\n</pre>\n\n<p>Or to only allow specific users -\n\n</p><p></p><pre>    CRED_SUPER_USERS = mike, todd</pre>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2017-Jul-14 10:14:22 by tim:</em> <br/>\n\nThis behavior changed in 8.5.8 with changes for ticket <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=5984\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('5984'); return false;\" title=\"Don't allow one user to store credentials for another user\">#5984</a></span>\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Dec-19 11:26:10 by johnkn:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>CODE_REVIEW</strong> : change looks good.  although I think the comparison should always be case-insensitive because a pool may be mixed windows/Linux but you will only have 1 credd.\n\n<p></p><hr/>\n<em>2018-Dec-20 10:27:58 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\nTJ and I discussed the case sensitive comparison and decided any changes can wait, and should probably include other places in the code with similar concerns.</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=7624\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('7624'); return false;\" title=\"clean up client to CredD interface for user impersonation\">#7624</a></span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"center\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon ptr1\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\nclean up client to CredD interface for user impersonation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Dec-20 10:24</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/f907d3aaf870d6c8cd2923afa6518108bbce8468\">[55901]</a></span>: Docs for new CRED_SUPER_USERS param. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6346\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6346'); return false;\" title=\"condor_store_cred won't accept registration of dedicated user cred.\">#6346</a></span>  (By Jaime Frey )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2018-Dec-11 11:20</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/3f931f017cad7222cfc24dc267ac28d852cb1781\">[55884]</a></span>: Allow some users to do store_cred for other accounts. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=6346\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('6346'); return false;\" title=\"condor_store_cred won't accept registration of dedicated user cred.\">#6346</a></span> Reintroduce config param CRED_SUPER_USERS from the old credd.
