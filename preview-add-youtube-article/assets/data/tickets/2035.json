They're intended for condor_ssh_to_job, but are present for the basic job.  This is unnecessarily confusing.\n\n<p>Proposed:\n\n</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>Don't set _CONDOR_JOB_PIDS when starting the basic job.  It's empty anyway, so it's entirely deadweight.\n</li><li>Either remove _CONDOR_JOB_IWD when starting a basic job (it's intended for condor_ssh_to_job, is redundant with the actual IWD, and deadweight), or document it as a feature in manual section 2.5.5 (Users' Manual &gt; Submitting a Job &gt; Environment Variables)</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2011-Apr-04 15:05:26 by matt:</em> <br/>\n\nHow are they confusing?\n\n<p>They are useful from a job and hook perspective.</p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2012-Oct-17 13:20", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Apr-04 14:40", "fixed_version": "2011-Apr-04 14:40", "broken_version": "v070505", "priority": "4", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
