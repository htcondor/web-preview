{"id": 2517, "title": "Ticket #2517: Move GRAM4 and HDFS support into separate release.", "description": "<blockquote>\nThe working on having Condor use dynamic libraries (<span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1135\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1135'); return false;\" title='\"Real\" dynamic binary releases'>#1135</a></span>) is showing that we can make much smaller Condor releases.\n\n<p>jfrey's current branch on this work reveals that of the 158 MB installed on an x86-64 RHEL4 release of Condor, 34 MB is GRAM4 support and 48MB is HDFS support. Over half of the install is support for two features that most users don't use. Given that the files in question are largely .jar files, and thus compressed, it's likely that more well over half of the Condor tar.gz is this support.\n\n</p><p>Proposed: Move GRAM4 and HDFS support into separate release for the users that need the functionality. This will benefit the users who don't need that support, speeding downloads and reducing installation size.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2011-Sep-30 14:03", "status": "new", "created": "2011-Sep-30 14:03", "fixed_version": "2011-Sep-30 14:03", "broken_version": "v070600", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "adesmet", "rust": "", "customer_group": "other", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
