{"id": 4249, "title": "Ticket #4249: condor_q extremely large memory usage", "description": "<blockquote>\nCurrently, dprintf buffers all statements until 'dprintf_config' is called.\n\n<p>For a tool (condor_q), this never happens so the buffer grows indefinitely.  When using \"-userlog\" mode, there's 2 log lines per event (one for locking and one for unlocking).  In my testing, this caused &gt;100MB of RAM to be used by a condor_q invocation.\n\n</p><p>For now, the workaround is to add the \"-debug\" flag and pipe stderr to /dev/null.  This causes dprintf_config and prevents the buffering.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "todo", "last_change": "2014-Jul-28 13:23", "status": "new", "created": "2014-Mar-07 14:52", "fixed_version": "2014-Mar-07 14:52", "broken_version": "", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "", "assigned_to": "", "derived_from": "", "creator": "bbockelm", "rust": "", "customer_group": "cms", "visibility": "public", "notify": "", "due_date": ""}
