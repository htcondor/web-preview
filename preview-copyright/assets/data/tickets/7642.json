{"id": 7642, "title": "Ticket #7642: for ALL NonNegotiatedSessions make sure the version info is propagated", "description": "<blockquote>\nWe recently added propagation of version info from Execute node to Submit node.  There are other places where we create non-negotiated sessions, for example:\n<ul>\n<li>Parent/Child\n</li><li>SchedD/Negotiator\n</li><li>gridmanager/ft-gahp\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Currently, none of these are \"important\" because either the version information is propagated through another means, is inferred due to daemon locality, or is not needed.  However, I created this ticket to do a few things:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Double check the existing locations to make sure the above assumptions of being \"not important\" are true.\n</li><li>See if there are any other locations in the code that use <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=NonNegotiatedSessions\" title=\"Non Negotiated Sessions\">NonNegotiatedSessions</a></span>\n</li><li>Add the info anyway so in the future the version info is available if/when we need it\n</li><li>See if there is a better way to enforce that the version info is always present (e.g. by enforcing that the <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=ShortVersion\" title=\"Short Version\">ShortVersion</a></span> always be part of the imported classad for <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=NonNegSess\" title=\"Non Neg Sess\">NonNegSess</a></span>, or is a required parameter to the functions, etc.)</li></ul>\n</blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2020-May-15 10:07", "status": "new", "created": "2020-May-15 10:04", "fixed_version": "2020-May-15 10:04", "broken_version": "v080900", "priority": "3", "subsystem": "Security", "assigned_to": "zmiller", "derived_from": "#7565", "creator": "zmiller", "rust": "", "customer_group": "chtc", "visibility": "public", "notify": "zmiller@cs.wisc.edu, tannenba@cs.wisc.edu, jfrey@cs.wisc.edu", "due_date": ""}
