{"id": 1378, "title": "Ticket #1378: force-auth commands broken when security negotiation off", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen SEC_DEFAULT_NEGOTIATION=NEVER or anything equivalent that causes security negotiation not to happen, <code>DaemonCore</code> rejects commands that are registered with force_authentication=true.\n\n<p>The fix that Zach and I agreed on is to make <code>DaemonCore</code> do the authentication for the incoming connection.\n\n</p><p>This means that we can eventually remove all of the server-side code that does authentication in the command-handler of commands that are registered with force_authentication=true.  It would be nice to also remove the client-side code that does the authentication in the command protocol and instead have it done inside of startCommand().  This would either require passing an argument to startCommand() or having built-in knowledge about which commands always require authentication.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n</blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Apr-27 09:27</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/1bad7a5a777b17d86d73f3b3a82113f78d286250\">[25444]</a></span>: Documented fix for force-auth commands when security negotiation is disabled. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1378\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1378'); return false;\" title=\"force-auth commands broken when security negotiation off\">#1378</a></span>  (By Dan Bradley )</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">2010-Apr-27 09:16</td>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\">\n<span class=\"icon dot\">\u00a0</span></td>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"> \nCheck-in <span class=\"chng\"><a href=\"https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/commit/00fb2a86ea1138138f0f76c248ad844b4520bd4c\">[17922]</a></span>: Fixed commands that are registered with force_authentication=true. <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1378\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1378'); return false;\" title=\"force-auth commands broken when security negotiation off\">#1378</a></span> As of 7.5.0, <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=DaemonCore\" title=\"Daemon Core\">DaemonCore</a></span> rejects unauthenticated connections if the command is registered with force_authentication=true.
