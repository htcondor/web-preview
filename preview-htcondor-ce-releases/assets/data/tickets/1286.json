{"id": 1286, "title": "Ticket #1286: shadow born w/a security session to the schedd", "description": "<blockquote>\nWhen the schedd creates a shadow, that shadow then immediately has to turn around and negotiate a security session with the schedd, which can be a fair amount of work on a fully loaded schedd.  Instead it may be better to pass the information to the shadow such that when it is born a security session already exists.\n\n<p>This should alleviate some issues where the shadow will exit if is can not negotiate the session within a given time-frame.</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\nAfter further investigation it was discovered that this is definitely sub-optimal, but it's not a major performance concern.  Other tickets will be written to address those concerns.\n\n<p>No longer an issue re <span class=\"ticket\"><a class=\"resolved\" href=\"/wiki-archive/tickets/?ticket=1375\" onclick=\"get_ticket_and_populate_wrapper('1375'); return false;\" title=\"reuse shadow processes\">#1375</a></span></p></blockquote>", "derived_tickets": "", "attachments": "<html><head></head><body></body></html>", "check_ins": "", "type": "enhance", "last_change": "2010-Apr-27 10:36", "status": "abandoned", "created": "2010-Mar-17 10:48", "fixed_version": "2010-Mar-17 10:48", "broken_version": "v070500", "priority": "5", "subsystem": "Daemons", "assigned_to": "PitS", "derived_from": "#1284", "creator": "tstclair", "rust": "", "customer_group": "users", "visibility": "public", "notify": "matt@cs.wisc.edu, dan@hep.wisc.edu, tstclair@redhat.com", "due_date": ""}
