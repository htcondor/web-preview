{"id": 4163, "title": "Ticket #4163: Schedd crashes when using PeriodicRemove for parallel jobs", "description": "<blockquote>\nIf you submit a parallel job with a periodic remove expression this crashes the scheduler when it tries to remove the job. I experienced this problem in the following scenario:\n\n<p>I'm submitting jobs via -remote to a remote dedicated scheduler. The job itself copies the result data to a central place on a file server and, thus, I don't need to transfer any data back using condor_transfer_data. Therefore, I want the scheduler to remove the job automatically and defined a \"<span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=PeriodicRemove\" title=\"Periodic Remove\">PeriodicRemove</a></span>\" expression in my submit script. If I do this for a parallel job the scheduler crashes when removing the job. Looking at the code I found the problematic part. It seems that during the remove operation of a job cluster the schedd tries to access data structures which have been deleted before. I don't understand the code completely but as I only submit jobs which have a single job per cluster the attached patch helped me to solve the issue for my version of condor. It will be problematic probably if you have multiple clusters in a job, so someone with a better understanding of the code should have a look...</p></blockquote>", "remarks": "<blockquote>\n<em>2014-Feb-05 15:56:29 by jfrey:</em> <br/>\n\n<strong>Code Review</strong>\n\n<p>With this change, most of the logic in DestroyProc() is only performed for one proc in the cluster.\nThis includes the following:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Setting <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=CompletionDate\" title=\"Completion Date\">CompletionDate</a></span> in the job ad\n</li><li>Checking <span class=\"wiki\"><a class=\"missing\" href=\"wiki?p=LeaveJobInQueue\" title=\"Leave Job In Queue\">LeaveJobInQueue</a></span> (though probably don't want to leave only some of the procs in the queue)\n</li><li>Writing to the history file\n</li><li>Writing the per-job history file\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>I presume in the common case that DestroyProc() is called on proc_id 0.
