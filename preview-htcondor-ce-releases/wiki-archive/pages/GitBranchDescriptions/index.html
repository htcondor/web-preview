  <br/>
  A branch off of V6_7 for Andy Pavlo's work to add cron-like

   includes: job "deferal" in the starter to spawn a job at a specific
   time, a Requirements expression for local universe jobs, cron-like
   scheduling attributes for jobs that turn into a time-to-next-start
   clause in the requirements expr, etc.  Created from the

  The state of the V6_6-branch for a merge into V6_7-branch.  Fixes
   a bunch of condor_tests stuff, such that we should be close to all

   notwithstanding), NMI glue, the nmi_glue/submit_info input file for
   the new/improved condor_nmi_submit.pl script, a fix in CEDAR to
   deal with badly formed packets not causing an EXCEPT(), and some
   other minor fixes (e.g. to clarify some dprintfs, a README, etc).

  The official 6.7.10 release.  The packages for most platforms came
   from NWO build #9645, except irix-6.5 came from OWO build 1315, and
   windows was built by hand.  This is almost exactly the same source
   as BUILD-V6_7_10-branch-2005-8-3, however, there were 3 minor
   changes to files in NTconfig that were necessary.  Since that
   didn't touch the source at all, it wasn't worth a whole other

  <br/>
  A new branch for the 6.7.9 release, created from V6_7_9-2-root on
   the V6_7_CODE module (doc will remain with the V6_7_9-branch).
   There were too many changes and merges that had to happen, and it

   release branch than to do everything in the old V6_7_9-branch.

  <strong>
   05/17/05 V6_7-gcb-2-branch
  </strong>
  <br/>
  A new branch off V6_7 for the final (hopefully) GCB integration.
   This is the branch that's just going to rely on the GNU ld's --wrap
   functionality to re-map socket calls to Generic_*, instead of
   changing all the HTCondor source.  we'll still have to make some
   fixes, e.g. in my_ip_addr(), but this will be much easier to
   maintain, and it'll also work with most of the externals, too.
   Created from the V6_7-gcb-2-root tag on V6_7_CODE..

  <br/>
  This is a new branch off the end of the V6_6-branch for changes to
   get HTCondor to link with and use Kerberos5 version 1.3.x.  The
   Kerberos API changed between 1.2.x and 1.3.x, and there are a
   number of security enhancements and portability fixes that are
   driving us to want to switch to krb5-1.3.x.  So, we've got this
   branch so that we can isolate the changes, do builds on all our
   platforms, and heavily test the new kerberos before we merge it
   back into the stable code-base.

   "BUILD-V6_6-branch-2003-11-13" and "BUILD-V6_6_0-2003-11-12" (both
   of which might go away eventually).  This tag lives on the
   V6_6-branch for the V6_6_ALL module, and on the trunk for the
   entire externals tree.  In NMI land most of the binaries/tarballs
   came from build ID 1715.  The test suite ran on most platforms via
   build
  <span class="ticket">
   <a class="resolved" href="../../tickets/?ticket=1707" title="improve scalability of shadow logging">

  </span>
  (equivalent source tag).  Solaris 9 and MacOSX had to
   be tested by hand, and Alpha-DUX-40f had to be built and tested by
   hand due to unexplainable errors building the globus external via
   the nightly builds.  Hopefully IRIX will use this same tag
   eventually, but right now, we don't have a functional build machine
   to use.  Maybe NMI will be stable enough to do the full build by
   6.6.1.  The version string for all platforms (except IRIX and maybe
   windows) is: "$CondorVersion: 6.6.0 Nov 13 2003 $"
   NOTE: this is also the last tag of the source that includes all the
   build system wisdom regarding X86 Solaris, Solaris 2.5.1, IRIX 6.2,
   and pre-glibc versions of Linux (everything before rh7.2, in fact).
   I modified all the build system files to purge these platforms
   since we're no longer supporting them, and they were causing
   needless complication in various ways.  This change also
   corresponds with moving platform detection from condor_imake into
   the configure script under the new build system.  Finally, i purged
   a bunch of really old code from condor_ckpt and condor_syscall_lib,
   such as: AIX3.2, ULTRIX, SUNOS, HPUX9, and IRIX53.

        have to release a 6.3.1 from this branch, as well, depending

  <br/>
  This is a new branch (with the same name) for UMN folks who
        want to hack DAGMan.  Since the old umn branch was created
        before the big CEDAR cleanup in CVS, and since we didn't want
        any trouble with that down the road, we wanted to make a new
        branch for them before they started their work.  Since nothing
        had been checked in to the new branch, we could safely delete
        the old branch tag (which I did in both the V6_3-branch and in
        the V6_3-bandwidth-branch to make sure we removed that tag
        from all files, even ones that had been deleted on the main

  <br/>
  6.1.16 release tag, which lives on the V6_2-branch.  config
        was tagged on 9/12, with the code from the earlier date.
        NTconfig and doc were tagged on 9/13/00 with the tail of the
        branch (since I don't think NTconfig changed, doc didn't
        change much, and it doesn't matter nearly as much) There are
        now a bunch more module names and renewed awareness of using
        the *_ALL module names to help avoid these sorts of things in

        features, Globus universe stuff, HTCondor-G, Personal HTCondor
        stuff, etc.  It should
  <strong>
   NOT

  <strong>
   NEVER

  be merged directly into the trunk.  They
  <strong>
